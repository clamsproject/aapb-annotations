# AAPB-CLAMS annotation repository 

This repository contains datasets from manual annotation projects in [AAPB](https://americanarchive.org/) - [CLAMS](https://clama.ai) collaboration. 

## Structure of this repository

Each directory in this repository contains a dataset from a specific annotation project. The directory name is the name of the project. Each directory contains the following files:

* `README.md`: annotation project-specific information, such as
    * annotation project name
    * annotator demographics
    * annotation environment information (name, version, link, user manual, etc.)
    * gold generation code dependency
    * and more
    * This file is supposed to be actively maintained by the project manager, whenever there is a change in the annotation project, including addition of new batches, change in annotator personnel, etc. 
* `guidelines.md`: annotation guidelines used in the annotation project.
    * This file is supposed to be actively maintained by the project manager, whenever there is a change in the annotation scheme, and all past schemes and guidlines are recommended to be version-controlled. 
* `process.{sh,py}`: a script to process the manual annotations and generate public "gold" dataset. In addition to this file, if the code requires additional dependencies scripts, they can stay in the same directory. In case the dependencies are managed by a package manager (e.g., `pip`), the project manager **must** provide relevant information in the `README.md` file.
* `YYMMDD-batchName` directory: these sub-directories contains output files from the manual annotation process. The `YYMMDD-` prefix **must** indicate the time when a batch of annotation is conducted. The `batchName` part of the directory name **must** match only one of `.txt` files in the *batches*. See below for more information on the `batches` directory.
* `golds` directory: this directory contains the public "gold" dataset generated by `process.py` script. The script **must** generate one file per GUID (video/audio/text document) and the number of gold files in this directory **must** match the sum of GUIDs in all batches annotated. 

## Source data batches

A special directory `batches` contains source data batches used in the annotation projects. Specifically, the directory contains `.txt` files named after the batch name. Batch names are usually named after the relevant GitHub issue from [AAPB-CLAMS collaboration repository](https://github.com/clamsproject/aapb-collaboration). Each line in a `.txt` file **must** be a single AAPB GUID, with an exception of any lines starts with `# `, which should be treated as comments.
