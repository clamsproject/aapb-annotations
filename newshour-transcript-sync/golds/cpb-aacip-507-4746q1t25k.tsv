1	00:02:13.730	00:02:16.960	Good evening, I'm Gwen Ifill, Jim Lehrer is off today.
2	00:02:16.970	00:02:20.510	On the NewsHour tonight, Ray Suarez introduces us to three
3	00:02:20.520	00:02:24.430	new faces for the proposed Bush cabinet; we examine the
4	00:02:24.440	00:02:28.870	already contentious fight over the nominee for Attorney General; and
5	00:02:28.880	00:02:32.010	Elizabeth Farnsworth takes us into the middle of the thorny
6	00:02:32.020	00:02:36.300	dispute over Palestinians who want to return to Israel. It
7	00:02:36.310	00:03:23.200	all follows our summary of the news this Tuesday. President-elect
8	00:03:23.210	00:03:26.800	Bush rounded out his cabinet today. He tapped a Democrat,
9	00:03:26.810	00:03:31.400	Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta, to head the Transportation Department. He
10	00:03:31.410	00:03:35.550	also picked former Reagan administration official, Linda Chavez for Labor
11	00:03:35.560	00:03:41.030	Secretary and outgoing Michigan Senator Spencer Abraham as Energy Secretary.
12	00:03:41.040	00:03:43.440	He said his nominees show the kind of leader he
13	00:03:43.450	00:03:47.940	will be. I believe the American people want a President
14	00:03:47.950	00:03:52.440	who seeks the best. People from all walks of life
15	00:03:52.450	00:03:57.950	who are strong, experienced, capable Americans. I'm going to work
16	00:03:57.960	00:04:01.970	with every cabinet member to set a series of goals
17	00:04:01.980	00:04:06.740	for each cabinet, for each area of our government, and
18	00:04:06.750	00:04:09.090	I'll work with the cabinet secretaries to help achieve those
19	00:04:09.100	00:04:13.670	goals. But I fully expect to get...I fully expect
20	00:04:13.680	00:04:19.430	to be given straightforward talk, honest opinion, and I expect
21	00:04:19.440	00:04:21.670	people to work for one thing in mind: That which
22	00:04:21.680	00:04:24.690	is best for America. And I'm proud of this cabinet.
23	00:04:24.700	00:04:27.960	We'll have more about today's cabinet selections right after this
24	00:04:27.970	00:04:32.150	News Summary. Palestinian leader Arafat met with President Clinton at
25	00:04:32.160	00:04:36.020	the White House today. He wanted clarification of U.S. proposals
26	00:04:36.030	00:04:38.840	for a Middle East peace agreement. The proposals would grant
27	00:04:38.850	00:04:44.060	Palestinians partial control in East Jerusalem. But Palestinian refugees would
28	00:04:44.070	00:04:47.280	give up their right to return to Israel. White House
29	00:04:47.290	00:04:50.930	spokesman Jake Siewert said the President hopes for progress before
30	00:04:50.940	00:04:54.080	he leaves office in three weeks. The time is of
31	00:04:54.090	00:04:57.520	the essence here. We have a relatively narrow window of
32	00:04:57.530	00:05:00.840	opportunity, but the President has promised to work up to
33	00:05:00.850	00:05:05.550	the last day, and there's no reason why these negotiations--
34	00:05:05.560	00:05:10.700	if they commence--could not be successful. But ultimately it's
35	00:05:10.710	00:05:14.330	up to the parties to decide to sit down and
36	00:05:14.340	00:05:17.710	to make the hard choices that are involved. In Jerusalem,
37	00:05:17.720	00:05:21.310	Israeli Prime Minister Barak said it was unlikely there would
38	00:05:21.320	00:05:25.460	be any peace accord before the Israeli elections next month.
39	00:05:25.470	00:05:28.680	And the violence in the region continued today. In Gaza,
40	00:05:28.690	00:05:32.900	Israeli troops killed a Palestinian man and wounded seven. And
41	00:05:32.910	00:05:38.270	roadside bombs wounded two Israeli soldiers. There were significant lapses
42	00:05:38.280	00:05:42.560	in U.S. security in the Persian Gulf before the attack
43	00:05:42.570	00:05:45.830	on the U.S.S. "Cole." That's what a Pentagon commission has
44	00:05:45.840	00:05:50.220	concluded, according to reports today by major news organizations. They
45	00:05:50.230	00:05:55.120	cite a communications breakdown between embassies and military commanders. The
46	00:05:55.130	00:05:58.320	"Cole" was ripped by a suicide bomb blast on October
47	00:05:58.330	00:06:02.120	12th, in the port of Aden, Yemen. On Wall Street
48	00:06:02.130	00:06:07.160	today, stocks dropped on continuing fears about lackluster corporate earnings.
49	00:06:07.170	00:06:10.730	The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 140 points to close
50	00:06:10.740	00:06:16.320	at 10,646. The NASDAQ Index fell 178 points or about
51	00:06:16.330	00:06:21.300	7.2% to close at 2291. That's it for the News
52	00:06:21.310	00:06:25.630	Summary tonight, now it's on to the Bush cabinet choices,
53	00:06:25.640	00:06:30.440	and the Ashcroft controversy, plus the Palestinians' right of return
54	00:06:30.450	00:06:41.860	to Israel. Three new faces for the President-elect's cabinet, one
55	00:06:41.870	00:06:46.250	a Democrat, and to Ray Suarez. The three final cabinet
56	00:06:46.260	00:06:49.230	appointments came late this afternoon at a press conference in
57	00:06:49.240	00:06:53.320	Austin. Mr. Bush's choice to head the Energy Department, Michigan
58	00:06:53.330	00:06:57.600	Senator Spencer Abraham, lost his seat to Democrat Debbie Stabenow
59	00:06:57.610	00:07:02.820	last year. The one-term, 48-year-old Senator is a fiscal conservative
60	00:07:02.830	00:07:07.450	whose grandparents were Lebanese immigrants. Abraham served in the previous
61	00:07:07.460	00:07:11.040	Bush administration as deputy chief of staff to Vice President
62	00:07:11.050	00:07:15.580	Dan Quayle. Many significant Energy Department-related issues face us at
63	00:07:15.590	00:07:20.760	this time, ranging from the adequacy of supply to affordability,
64	00:07:20.770	00:07:23.210	to the development of new technologies, to the issues of
65	00:07:23.220	00:07:27.950	security at our facilities and more. Fortunately, this administration is
66	00:07:27.960	00:07:32.350	comprised of many individuals with incredible expertise in these areas,
67	00:07:32.360	00:07:35.780	and I look forward to helping the President-elect to effectively
68	00:07:35.790	00:07:39.300	address these challenges in the days ahead. Linda Chavez, the
69	00:07:39.310	00:07:43.190	President-elect's pick for Labor Secretary, is the second Hispanic selected
70	00:07:43.200	00:07:46.510	for a cabinet post. Chavez is President of the Center
71	00:07:46.520	00:07:51.220	for Equal Opportunity, a conservative research organization in Washington, DC.
72	00:07:51.230	00:07:54.370	She served as White House Director of Public Liaison and
73	00:07:54.380	00:07:56.720	Director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in the
74	00:07:56.730	00:08:01.750	Reagan administration. She ran for Senate from Maryland in 1986,
75	00:08:01.760	00:08:05.000	but lost. Today, Chavez thanked her father, who was a
76	00:08:05.010	00:08:07.970	house painter, and her mother, who worked in restaurants and
77	00:08:07.980	00:08:12.250	department stores. If I am confirmed as Secretary of Labor,
78	00:08:12.260	00:08:14.990	I intend to keep faith with the men and the
79	00:08:15.000	00:08:18.300	women who still work at jobs like those my parents
80	00:08:18.310	00:08:22.770	held. I hope also to seek out new opportunities to
81	00:08:22.780	00:08:27.200	increase the skills and the productivity of all Americans, to
82	00:08:27.210	00:08:31.040	promote safe working conditions, and to administer the nation's labor
83	00:08:31.050	00:08:36.890	laws. I intend to vigorously enforce the Department's regulations to
84	00:08:36.900	00:08:42.340	guarantee nondiscrimination by federal contractors. And I want to work
85	00:08:42.350	00:08:45.870	with employers to ensure that the Department of Labor assists
86	00:08:45.880	00:08:50.810	the private sector in expanding economic opportunity and job growth.
87	00:08:50.820	00:08:54.870	In naming current Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta to be Transportation
88	00:08:54.880	00:08:59.350	Secretary, President-elect Bush fulfilled a promise to name a Democrat
89	00:08:59.360	00:09:03.380	to his cabinet. President Clinton tapped the 69-year-old Mineta to
90	00:09:03.390	00:09:07.100	be Secretary of Commerce last summer. Mineta was a Senior
91	00:09:07.110	00:09:11.410	Vice President of Transportation Systems and Services at Lockheed Martin.
92	00:09:11.420	00:09:14.630	He served as a Democratic Congressman from California for 20
93	00:09:14.640	00:09:18.950	years, chairing the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation
94	00:09:18.960	00:09:22.740	and the Aviation Subcommittee. Mineta was also the mayor of
95	00:09:22.750	00:09:28.090	San Jose. Over the last year, this country has witnessed
96	00:09:28.100	00:09:33.530	a very hard-fought election, and I was proud to stand
97	00:09:33.540	00:09:37.420	with my party. I have been honored to serve in
98	00:09:37.430	00:09:42.610	President Clinton's cabinet as Secretary of Commerce. I am a
99	00:09:42.620	00:09:49.020	Democrat--with both a small "d" and a large one--
100	00:09:49.030	00:09:52.330	and I am proud of and committed to my party's
101	00:09:52.340	00:09:58.130	principles and its heritage. However, the campaign is over, and
102	00:09:58.140	00:10:03.420	under our constitutional system, a decision has been rendered. And
103	00:10:03.430	00:10:08.030	we are now in the essential transition period when we
104	00:10:08.040	00:10:13.050	move from campaigning to governance. As you have said time
105	00:10:13.060	00:10:18.720	and time again, Mr. President-elect, the challenge before all of
106	00:10:18.730	00:10:24.920	us as Americans, regardless of party affiliation, is to find
107	00:10:24.930	00:10:30.470	those areas where we can build bipartisan consensus on the
108	00:10:30.480	00:10:34.640	policies and the programs that are needed to move this
109	00:10:34.650	00:10:38.080	nation forward. I believe that there is no more fertile
110	00:10:38.090	00:10:43.980	ground for building a bipartisan consensus on what is necessary
111	00:10:43.990	00:10:48.500	and right for our country than in the area of
112	00:10:48.510	00:10:54.930	transportation policy. There are no Democratic or Republican highways, no
113	00:10:54.940	00:11:01.090	such thing as Republican or Democratic traffic congestion, no such
114	00:11:01.100	00:11:08.150	thing as Republican or Democratic aviation and highway safety. Cargo
115	00:11:08.160	00:11:14.500	is not shipped by Republican or Democratic railroad ships, barges,
116	00:11:14.510	00:11:21.910	or pipelines. Our national transportation policy must have one overriding
117	00:11:21.920	00:11:26.950	bipartisan goal, and that is to give our economy the
118	00:11:26.960	00:11:31.230	tools and the infrastructure it needs in order to create
119	00:11:31.240	00:11:37.180	and sustain growth and prosperity. After announcing his cabinet appointments,
120	00:11:37.190	00:11:39.940	Mr. Bush took questions on a variety of topics this
121	00:11:39.950	00:11:45.470	afternoon including energy policy. Mr. President-elect, OPEC plans to cut
122	00:11:45.480	00:11:48.020	oil production by a million and a half barrels on
123	00:11:48.030	00:11:52.610	January 17th. Are you concerned this will affect the current
124	00:11:52.620	00:11:56.480	heating oil situation or raise gas prices in the future?
125	00:11:56.490	00:11:59.370	And would you consider raising the issue with the Saudis
126	00:11:59.380	00:12:03.700	or other OPEC members before that January 17 meeting? No,
127	00:12:03.710	00:12:06.240	the nation needs to speak with one voice. We have
128	00:12:06.250	00:12:10.280	one President. But the fact that OPEC is thinking about
129	00:12:10.290	00:12:14.010	reducing the world supply of crude oil and thereby affecting
130	00:12:14.020	00:12:16.700	the price at the pump and the price of heating
131	00:12:16.710	00:12:20.140	oil indicates the need for us to have an energy
132	00:12:20.150	00:12:23.200	policy that makes us less dependent on foreign sources of
133	00:12:23.210	00:12:26.420	crude. The ideal world is one in which we don't
134	00:12:26.430	00:12:30.540	have to worry about somebody reducing supplies on the world
135	00:12:30.550	00:12:33.880	markets. We've got a long way to go from there.
136	00:12:33.890	00:12:36.600	But we need to be exploring, in an environmentally sensitive
137	00:12:36.610	00:12:41.640	way, for oil and gas here at home. Secondly, a
138	00:12:41.650	00:12:46.230	cornerstone of our diplomatic efforts will be to work with
139	00:12:46.240	00:12:52.800	our friends in the Middle East, particularly as it relates
140	00:12:52.810	00:12:55.770	to matters of energy. But know the President of the
141	00:12:55.780	00:12:58.600	United States will be the President until January 20th, and
142	00:12:58.610	00:13:01.370	our nation will speak with one voice. Mr. President-elect, can
143	00:13:01.380	00:13:03.850	you talk about why you feel it's important to have
144	00:13:03.860	00:13:07.340	a Democrat in your cabinet besides the qualifications of Mr.
145	00:13:07.350	00:13:10.880	Mineta--the symbolism you feel it might bring. You bet.
146	00:13:10.890	00:13:13.210	First, I don't want to skip over the qualifications. This
147	00:13:13.220	00:13:16.730	man is perfectly suited for the job. He made a
148	00:13:16.740	00:13:21.200	career in the halls of Congress focusing on transportation issues
149	00:13:21.210	00:13:26.740	with a philosophy that we share. And I can't wait
150	00:13:26.750	00:13:30.080	for people in our party to hear Norm talk about
151	00:13:30.090	00:13:36.600	his vision for transportation. But it's also important to send
152	00:13:36.610	00:13:41.310	a signal that this is an administration that recognizes talent
153	00:13:41.320	00:13:44.500	when we see it regardless of political party. And this
154	00:13:44.510	00:13:49.330	is an extraordinarily talented American. I love his story. I'm
155	00:13:49.340	00:13:53.950	so honored that he agreed to join the administration, and
156	00:13:53.960	00:13:57.710	he's going to make a great addition. I wish everybody
157	00:13:57.720	00:14:00.320	a continued happy New Year. I look forward to seeing
158	00:14:00.330	00:14:04.870	you at the next availability. And now, how this is
159	00:14:04.880	00:14:08.520	playing on Capitol Hill? We're joined by two Senate leaders,
160	00:14:08.530	00:14:12.830	Republican Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant majority leader, and
161	00:14:12.840	00:14:17.420	Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority whip. Senator Nickles,
162	00:14:17.430	00:14:20.570	maybe we could start with you. You heard the President-elect
163	00:14:20.580	00:14:23.680	talk about the significance of appointing a Democrat to the
164	00:14:23.690	00:14:27.980	cabinet. It came in the last series of appointments, something
165	00:14:27.990	00:14:29.930	he said he wanted to do. As a member of
166	00:14:29.940	00:14:32.400	the Senate, what do you see as the significance? Well,
167	00:14:32.410	00:14:35.720	I like President-elect Bush doing what he said he's going
168	00:14:35.730	00:14:39.110	to do. I compliment him on his choice. I've known
169	00:14:39.120	00:14:41.360	Norm Mineta, I served with him when he was in
170	00:14:41.370	00:14:44.260	the House. He has a lot of respect. He did
171	00:14:44.270	00:14:46.850	a good job over at Commerce for President Clinton. And
172	00:14:46.860	00:14:48.900	I think he'll do a very good job as Secretary
173	00:14:48.910	00:14:53.620	of Transportation for President Bush. Senator Reid, same question. What
174	00:14:53.630	00:14:55.680	do you see as the significance of the appointment of
175	00:14:55.690	00:14:58.780	a Democrat to the cabinet? I think it's very important.
176	00:14:58.790	00:15:01.530	I think Secretary Cohen has been an outstanding person for
177	00:15:01.540	00:15:05.650	America. He certainly hasn't hurt his Republican credentials. I think
178	00:15:05.660	00:15:07.590	Norm Mineta will be a good Democrat and do a
179	00:15:07.600	00:15:10.800	great job with transportation. Frankly, I don't know of anyone
180	00:15:10.810	00:15:13.630	in America that could have been chosen that knows more
181	00:15:13.640	00:15:16.410	about transportation than Norm Mineta. He served on the very
182	00:15:16.420	00:15:20.230	large infrastructure committee in the House, has 45 or 50
183	00:15:20.240	00:15:24.010	members. Maybe they've raised it to 60 now. It's a
184	00:15:24.020	00:15:28.490	huge committee. He's done the bill with us every five
185	00:15:28.500	00:15:31.750	years, the very important transportation bill. He's worked in the
186	00:15:31.760	00:15:35.750	private sector. I just think he will be a great
187	00:15:35.760	00:15:40.030	Secretary of Transportation. Is there a...while there's a similarity
188	00:15:40.040	00:15:45.140	in the numbers, a quantitative parity, is there a qualitative
189	00:15:45.150	00:15:48.350	difference between the portfolios? Was it a more significant thing
190	00:15:48.360	00:15:51.100	to make a Bill Cohen Secretary of Defense one of
191	00:15:51.110	00:15:54.060	the top jobs in the cabinet as opposed to making
192	00:15:54.070	00:15:57.540	a Democrat Secretary of Transportation? I felt all along that
193	00:15:57.550	00:15:59.510	we should have some parity, that it would have been
194	00:15:59.520	00:16:02.580	nice to have a Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense,
195	00:16:02.590	00:16:05.670	maybe an Attorney General, but, you know, we got what
196	00:16:05.680	00:16:08.850	we got and Norm Mineta is a qualified guy and
197	00:16:08.860	00:16:13.100	the President-elect has a right to pick anyone he wants.
198	00:16:13.110	00:16:16.400	We'll have to take each of them at face value,
199	00:16:16.410	00:16:20.550	have some hearings and see how things go. I don't
200	00:16:20.560	00:16:24.840	want the fact that Mineta wasn't chosen for Secretary of
201	00:16:24.850	00:16:27.110	Defense or one of the bigger positions to take away
202	00:16:27.120	00:16:30.310	from his qualifications. He is going to be real good.
203	00:16:30.320	00:16:34.550	Senator Nickles, is it an apples-to-apples comparison when you take
204	00:16:34.560	00:16:37.120	a look at the two departments and their prestige within
205	00:16:37.130	00:16:39.740	the cabinet? Well, I just think you look at the
206	00:16:39.750	00:16:43.470	appointments that President-elect Bush has made, I think they're outstanding.
207	00:16:43.480	00:16:46.970	If you look at the top positions, Colin Powell, Don
208	00:16:46.980	00:16:51.210	Rumsfeld, Paul O'Neill, those are outstanding people. Norm Mineta, as
209	00:16:51.220	00:16:55.530	my colleague Senator Reid said, he's exceptionally well qualified for
210	00:16:55.540	00:16:58.920	Secretary of Transportation. So he's got an all-star cabinet. I
211	00:16:58.930	00:17:01.490	think he did a fantastic job putting the cabinet together.
212	00:17:01.500	00:17:03.390	And I compliment him for doing it so quickly. That
213	00:17:03.400	00:17:08.150	was more difficult than one would anticipate because the election
214	00:17:08.160	00:17:10.640	took so long, but I think he's got a great
215	00:17:10.650	00:17:14.090	cabinet and I think they'll they will be a real
216	00:17:14.100	00:17:17.200	credit to America, and my compliments to the President for
217	00:17:17.210	00:17:20.440	putting together so quickly. Well, you mentioned that the election
218	00:17:20.450	00:17:25.630	took so long. In fact, the Bush process of appointing
219	00:17:25.640	00:17:28.520	the cabinet was shorter than a lot of modern Presidents.
220	00:17:28.530	00:17:31.980	He did it rather quickly, and now that we've seen
221	00:17:31.990	00:17:35.590	the shape of the complete proposed cabinet, what do you
222	00:17:35.600	00:17:39.300	think it says about how the President-elect intends to govern?
223	00:17:39.310	00:17:41.660	Well, I think it speaks very well for him. I
224	00:17:41.670	00:17:46.360	think it's a cabinet of almost unequaled stature from the
225	00:17:46.370	00:17:49.550	top positions all the way down. These are people who
226	00:17:49.560	00:17:53.420	are enormously well qualified, who can do a fantastic job,
227	00:17:53.430	00:17:58.090	who have a great deal of credibility, leadership, stature already
228	00:17:58.100	00:18:00.800	on their own. So, these aren't individuals that are going
229	00:18:00.810	00:18:04.640	to need on-the-job training, that are going to be overwhelmed
230	00:18:04.650	00:18:09.370	by bureaucracy or...and that could easily happen. All these
231	00:18:09.380	00:18:12.740	cabinet-level positions, they all have thousands of employees. They're enormously
232	00:18:12.750	00:18:16.830	complex. I think he's got some great people who will,
233	00:18:16.840	00:18:20.660	you know, grab the challenge and work with Congress. Most
234	00:18:20.670	00:18:23.940	all of them are professionals in the fact that they've
235	00:18:23.950	00:18:27.170	managed businesses or they've had enough experience either in the
236	00:18:27.180	00:18:31.420	Pentagon or in Congress that I think they'll work with
237	00:18:31.430	00:18:35.200	Congress--Democrats and Republicans--to get some positive accomplishments for
238	00:18:35.210	00:18:37.700	our country. But, Senator Nickles, when you look at their
239	00:18:37.710	00:18:41.410	backgrounds, when you look at the ideological strands of the
240	00:18:41.420	00:18:46.390	party that they represent, does this proposed cabinet reflect the
241	00:18:46.400	00:18:50.130	closeness of the election, the closeness of the national legislature?
242	00:18:50.140	00:18:52.720	Well, I just think it's an outstanding cabinet with very
243	00:18:52.730	00:18:58.180	good, qualified people. Again, whether you're talking about Don Rumsfeld
244	00:18:58.190	00:19:02.170	or you're talking about Paul O'Neill or John Ashcroft, several
245	00:19:02.180	00:19:04.860	of these people, these are outstanding people who are enormously
246	00:19:04.870	00:19:08.920	well qualified who, I think, will do a fantastic job
247	00:19:08.930	00:19:11.650	for our country. Senator Reid, you wanted to say? Ray,
248	00:19:11.660	00:19:15.480	I think that we have to realize that these people
249	00:19:15.490	00:19:20.070	haven't yet been confirmed by the Senate. I accept every
250	00:19:20.080	00:19:22.380	one of them at face value. I think we have
251	00:19:22.390	00:19:25.260	to say the President-elect has a right to choose anyone
252	00:19:25.270	00:19:27.400	he wants and he's done that. But now we go
253	00:19:27.410	00:19:30.840	into the hearing process. And I think, generally speaking, these
254	00:19:30.850	00:19:34.020	people are going to be confirmed but we know that
255	00:19:34.030	00:19:35.320	there are things that are going to come up during
256	00:19:35.330	00:19:39.340	the hearings as, I think, Linda Chavez, that's going to
257	00:19:39.350	00:19:41.260	be an interesting hearing. I think we're going to find
258	00:19:41.270	00:19:44.630	out what she has written about...you know, anyone that's
259	00:19:44.640	00:19:47.870	written a lot, we have to say, have they in
260	00:19:47.880	00:19:50.910	effect Borked themselves, that is, going back to the Bork
261	00:19:50.920	00:19:53.530	Supreme Court nomination he'd written so much that he wound
262	00:19:53.540	00:19:55.830	up trapping himself. We'll have to see what she has
263	00:19:55.840	00:19:58.020	written. We'll have to see what she's said. We have
264	00:19:58.030	00:20:00.460	to look at the Secretary of Interior very closely, Gale
265	00:20:00.470	00:20:03.820	Norton, to find out if her close association with Secretary
266	00:20:03.830	00:20:06.580	Watt has been something that disqualifies her. At this stage
267	00:20:06.590	00:20:07.950	I know nothing. I think we have to look at
268	00:20:07.960	00:20:11.690	our former colleague, John Ashcroft, who I think he's a
269	00:20:11.700	00:20:14.610	very fine man. But there are people who need to
270	00:20:14.620	00:20:17.010	look at what he said to find out what his
271	00:20:17.020	00:20:20.690	involvement was with the Ronnie White episode, to find out
272	00:20:20.700	00:20:22.730	if he's willing to enforce the laws as it relates
273	00:20:22.740	00:20:26.000	to clinic violence and other things. At this stage--I
274	00:20:26.010	00:20:30.060	repeat--at face value they're all fine, good people, but
275	00:20:30.070	00:20:32.850	the hearing process develops and goes off on tangents, we've
276	00:20:32.860	00:20:37.100	learned during the past 25 years, that develop different scenarios.
277	00:20:37.110	00:20:40.190	We'll have to wait and see. I do say this
278	00:20:40.200	00:20:44.000	in support of my counterpart on the Republican side: I
279	00:20:44.010	00:20:47.100	really think that President-elect Bush has done a good job
280	00:20:47.110	00:20:50.140	in getting these people to us very quickly. In years
281	00:20:50.150	00:20:53.700	past, we've waited and waited and waited for these nominations
282	00:20:53.710	00:20:57.360	to come to us. We, the Senate, have no problem
283	00:20:57.370	00:20:59.890	now. We can't blame it on Bush that we're not
284	00:20:59.900	00:21:02.770	doing these hearings hurriedly, that he's holding us up. It's
285	00:21:02.780	00:21:05.450	up to us to get a government in place as
286	00:21:05.460	00:21:08.970	quickly as we can. Well, Senator Nickles, you just heard
287	00:21:08.980	00:21:13.470	maybe not the Democratic Party's playbook but a couple names
288	00:21:13.480	00:21:17.350	have come up that may bring some added scrutiny. Are
289	00:21:17.360	00:21:22.050	you concerned about one or another of the various designates
290	00:21:22.060	00:21:24.410	having a rough time when it comes time for hearings?
291	00:21:24.420	00:21:27.840	No, I don't, Ray. I will just guess that all
292	00:21:27.850	00:21:31.780	of his nominees will be confirmed by overwhelming votes. That
293	00:21:31.790	00:21:34.710	doesn't mean we won't have some serious questions before the
294	00:21:34.720	00:21:38.360	confirmation process. Usually you hear people say, oh, they're really
295	00:21:38.370	00:21:41.060	going after John Ashcroft. I know John Ashcroft. I think
296	00:21:41.070	00:21:45.490	most of our colleagues know him. He's an outstanding Senator,
297	00:21:45.500	00:21:48.530	former governor, former Attorney General. You couldn't be more qualified
298	00:21:48.540	00:21:50.550	for the position of Attorney General. He had eight years
299	00:21:50.560	00:21:55.680	as Attorney General in Missouri, graduated from distinguished law schools
300	00:21:55.690	00:21:58.530	and was an outstanding Senator, happened to serve on the
301	00:21:58.540	00:22:04.430	Judiciary Committee. I think he's eminently qualified. I think he
302	00:22:04.440	00:22:07.950	will be confirmed with the rest and Gale Norton, I
303	00:22:07.960	00:22:09.940	happen to have known her. She was a candidate for
304	00:22:09.950	00:22:13.140	the Senate a few years ago. She will do a
305	00:22:13.150	00:22:17.820	very good job as secretary. So, anyway, I'm confident that
306	00:22:17.830	00:22:20.760	President-elect Bush has made some great nominations and they'll stand
307	00:22:20.770	00:22:24.430	up to the scrutiny of the confirmation process. One of
308	00:22:24.440	00:22:26.390	the things I hope that we'll do is make sure
309	00:22:26.400	00:22:31.390	we don't go into the Bork process and "Bork" somebody.
310	00:22:31.400	00:22:33.480	I hope that we don't try and crucify somebody because
311	00:22:33.490	00:22:36.520	they happen to be nominated for a cabinet-level position. We
312	00:22:36.530	00:22:38.230	need to review their records; we need to find out
313	00:22:38.240	00:22:42.720	where they stand on issues, but my guess is that
314	00:22:42.730	00:22:45.090	the Senate is going to start conducting itself a little
315	00:22:45.100	00:22:48.510	more appropriately, maybe the way we did several years ago,
316	00:22:48.520	00:22:52.210	where most nominees will be confirmed in pretty short order.
317	00:22:52.220	00:22:57.040	Well, during this small window of time between the naming
318	00:22:57.050	00:23:01.410	of the cabinet members and the beginning of the confirmation
319	00:23:01.420	00:23:04.200	process, is the fax machine in your office warm to
320	00:23:04.210	00:23:06.550	the touch? Is the phone ringing off the hook? What
321	00:23:06.560	00:23:10.150	happens about now for sitting Senators? Well, I'll let my
322	00:23:10.160	00:23:14.130	colleague answer right now. There's always intense scrutiny on anything
323	00:23:14.140	00:23:17.910	they've ever said or written. My friend, Senator Reid, said
324	00:23:17.920	00:23:20.660	something about Linda Chavez. She's been on TV; she's written
325	00:23:20.670	00:23:23.350	a lot. And so I'm sure they'll find some ammo
326	00:23:23.360	00:23:26.360	and maybe some people will try and destroy her record.
327	00:23:26.370	00:23:29.430	But I know her well, and she'll be an outstanding
328	00:23:29.440	00:23:32.260	Secretary of Labor and I'm sure she'll be confirmed as
329	00:23:32.270	00:23:35.950	well. But anything they've ever written, ever said, will be
330	00:23:35.960	00:23:39.940	used either for them or against them, but again with
331	00:23:39.950	00:23:43.420	this caliber of nominations, I think they'll all get through.
332	00:23:43.430	00:23:45.920	Senator Reid, are you starting to hear from advocacy groups
333	00:23:45.930	00:23:48.230	on one side or another? Of course. But the one
334	00:23:48.240	00:23:51.470	thing I want to elaborate on what Don has said:
335	00:23:51.480	00:23:55.310	You know, this nomination process is very difficult. Filling out
336	00:23:55.320	00:23:57.980	the forms is very difficult, not only for cabinet officers
337	00:23:57.990	00:24:01.180	but sub-cabinet and people within the White House and other
338	00:24:01.190	00:24:04.390	offices that make up this federal government. We've got to
339	00:24:04.400	00:24:07.480	make it easier to get people to want these jobs.
340	00:24:07.490	00:24:10.270	That's one of the difficult things. So I would hope
341	00:24:10.280	00:24:14.040	that when we go through the confirmation process with these
342	00:24:14.050	00:24:17.350	cabinet officers, we are thorough but we want to be
343	00:24:17.360	00:24:19.520	fair. I think we need to do that. We have
344	00:24:19.530	00:24:22.070	to make people want these jobs. What has developed over
345	00:24:22.080	00:24:24.710	the last twenty years in Washington is we're having trouble
346	00:24:24.720	00:24:27.660	getting people to take these jobs because of the brutality
347	00:24:27.670	00:24:30.400	of the process itself. And so I would hope we
348	00:24:30.410	00:24:33.080	can join together as Democrats and Republicans to make the
349	00:24:33.090	00:24:36.740	process more civil. Senator Reid, Senator Nickles, thank you both
350	00:24:36.750	00:24:41.130	for joining us. Still to come on the NewsHour tonight,
351	00:24:41.140	00:24:54.110	the Ashcroft controversy, and the Palestinian right of return debate.
352	00:24:54.120	00:24:57.400	Now, more on that brewing conflict over the nominee for
353	00:24:57.410	00:25:01.610	Attorney General. On the day he was nominated for Attorney
354	00:25:01.620	00:25:05.830	General, John Ashcroft said his only intent is to uphold
355	00:25:05.840	00:25:09.570	the law. Quite simply, we will strive to be a
356	00:25:09.580	00:25:15.800	guardian of liberty and equal justice. For freedom, as President-elect
357	00:25:15.810	00:25:20.460	Bush has noted, can flourish only in a culture defined
358	00:25:20.470	00:25:23.880	by the rule of law, a rule of law that
359	00:25:23.890	00:25:29.270	knows no class, that sees no color and bows to
360	00:25:29.280	00:25:32.920	no creed. Ashcroft became available for the justice job in
361	00:25:32.930	00:25:36.550	a highly unusual manner. He was defeated for reelection to
362	00:25:36.560	00:25:39.520	the Senate by the late Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan, who
363	00:25:39.530	00:25:42.820	was killed in a plane crash during the campaign. Carnahan's
364	00:25:42.830	00:25:45.910	widow, Jean, was appointed to take his place. Missouri is
365	00:25:45.920	00:25:51.370	a compassionate state, and I think in a very special
366	00:25:51.380	00:25:56.430	way they have demonstrated the compassion which they have. And
367	00:25:56.440	00:25:59.880	I hope that the outcome of this election is a
368	00:25:59.890	00:26:05.640	matter of comfort to Mrs. Carnahan. Ashcroft, 58, served two
369	00:26:05.650	00:26:08.330	terms as Governor of Missouri and one term in the
370	00:26:08.340	00:26:12.550	Senate. Last year, he contemplated--and then decided against--running
371	00:26:12.560	00:26:17.430	for President. Two lightning rod issues have clouded Ashcroft's nomination:
372	00:26:17.440	00:26:23.000	Abortion and race. Ashcroft opposes all abortion, including exceptions for
373	00:26:23.010	00:26:26.840	rape and incest. And he has argued that Ronnie White,
374	00:26:26.850	00:26:30.090	a Missouri Supreme Court Justice nominated by President Clinton to
375	00:26:30.100	00:26:34.940	the federal bench, is soft on crime. Today, the President-elect
376	00:26:34.950	00:26:41.320	defended his nominee. You've taken great pains to diversify your
377	00:26:41.330	00:26:44.100	cabinet, but are you concerned that with the nomination of
378	00:26:44.110	00:26:48.240	Senator Ashcroft and specifically the battle that is brewing coming
379	00:26:48.250	00:26:52.290	from civil rights groups and others--that that will undercut
380	00:26:52.300	00:26:55.790	that accomplishment in any way? First of all, David, I
381	00:26:55.800	00:27:01.360	would hope that all our nominations sail through, but that's
382	00:27:01.370	00:27:03.030	not generally the way it goes. I am sure there
383	00:27:03.040	00:27:04.690	is going to be some tough questioning for some of
384	00:27:04.700	00:27:08.110	our nominees. But they're all fully prepared to handle the
385	00:27:08.120	00:27:13.350	tough questioning. And I hope people do talk to John
386	00:27:13.360	00:27:18.080	Ashcroft about his vision of civil rights and his concept
387	00:27:18.090	00:27:21.270	of fairness in America--because I certainly did. I want
388	00:27:21.280	00:27:22.820	to remind you all that this is a man who
389	00:27:22.830	00:27:25.580	became the Attorney General of the state of Missouri--was
390	00:27:25.590	00:27:28.050	elected as the governor of the state of Missouri--and
391	00:27:28.060	00:27:31.200	a United States Senator in the state of Missouri; a
392	00:27:31.210	00:27:34.120	man who had a record of taking his heart and
393	00:27:34.130	00:27:36.290	philosophy to the people of a swing state and got
394	00:27:36.300	00:27:42.240	elected. And I'm confident that he’ll withstand the scrutiny about
395	00:27:42.250	00:27:49.170	his fairness and his heart. Unfortunately, sometimes politics enters into
396	00:27:49.180	00:27:53.940	the confirmation process. I understand that and so does he,
397	00:27:53.950	00:27:55.420	but I'm confident that when it is all said and
398	00:27:55.430	00:27:59.110	done Senator Ashcroft will be confirmed by the Senate. As
399	00:27:59.120	00:28:02.340	the debate over the Ashcroft nomination heats up, we turn
400	00:28:02.350	00:28:05.770	to four of the combatants. Kate Michelman is the President
401	00:28:05.780	00:28:10.350	of NARAL, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League,
402	00:28:10.360	00:28:13.820	Elaine Jones is the director of the NAACP Legal Defense
403	00:28:13.830	00:28:17.550	Fund, Clint Bolick is the litigation director at the Institute
404	00:28:17.560	00:28:21.120	for Justice, and Ken Conner is President of the Family
405	00:28:21.130	00:28:24.910	Research Council. Elaine Jones, from a legal point of view
406	00:28:24.920	00:28:27.970	looking at John Ashcroft as potential for being the nation’s
407	00:28:27.980	00:28:33.060	top lawyer, what is wrong or right with this nomination?
408	00:28:33.070	00:28:37.020	You know, Gwen, I wish I did not have to
409	00:28:37.030	00:28:43.600	be here opposing this nomination; but when you look at
410	00:28:43.610	00:28:49.550	John Ashcroft and his views overall, what you get is
411	00:28:49.560	00:28:53.690	a sense of a throwback to the fifties in terms
412	00:28:53.700	00:28:59.150	of our civil rights laws. They didn't exist. In the
413	00:28:59.160	00:29:02.690	last 35 years as a nation, we have gone through
414	00:29:02.700	00:29:08.540	fits and starts, up and down, creating this scheme of
415	00:29:08.550	00:29:12.440	civil rights protections for all of us, and now in
416	00:29:12.450	00:29:18.120	comes John Ashcroft opposing hate crimes, you know, looking...Very
417	00:29:18.130	00:29:23.360	differently looking at the whole question of employment discrimination--looking
418	00:29:23.370	00:29:28.280	at the whole issue of representation on the bench, on
419	00:29:28.290	00:29:31.650	a diverse federal bench. I mean, and so it just
420	00:29:31.660	00:29:35.870	gives you a real sense that we are in some
421	00:29:35.880	00:29:40.040	very serious jeopardy of holding on to that fabric that
422	00:29:40.050	00:29:43.100	we as a nation have fought to establish. Clint Bolick,
423	00:29:43.110	00:29:46.700	Elaine Jones speaks in apocalyptic terms about this nomination. In
424	00:29:46.710	00:29:50.840	extreme and excessive terms. John Ashcroft is a man who
425	00:29:50.850	00:29:54.440	believes to the core of his soul in the civil
426	00:29:54.450	00:29:57.680	rights laws of this country. He signed the first hate
427	00:29:57.690	00:30:02.990	crimes legislation in Missouri history. He voted for 26 out
428	00:30:03.000	00:30:09.080	of 28 minority appointments of President Clinton to the Bench.
429	00:30:09.090	00:30:12.650	The two he voted against--one, Ronnie White, was opposed
430	00:30:12.660	00:30:16.130	by 55 members of the United States Senate, including such
431	00:30:16.140	00:30:19.720	moderates as Jim Jeffords and Arlen Specter. The other was
432	00:30:19.730	00:30:24.010	withdrawn by President Clinton. He signed into law the Martin
433	00:30:24.020	00:30:29.200	Luther King Birthday holiday in Missouri, which was contentious elsewhere.
434	00:30:29.210	00:30:32.970	This is a man who will restore integrity to the
435	00:30:32.980	00:30:38.030	Justice Department, which desperately needs that integrity. What Elaine Jones
436	00:30:38.040	00:30:42.990	doesn't like is that times have changed and that a
437	00:30:43.000	00:30:46.700	majority of Americans think that the era of racial division
438	00:30:46.710	00:30:50.310	ought to be over; so too does John Ashcroft. Ken
439	00:30:50.320	00:30:53.550	Conner, the other big issue, of course, is abortion. As
440	00:30:53.560	00:30:58.100	you know, of course, John Ashcroft is very much anti-abortion.
441	00:30:58.110	00:31:00.280	Is this something that you...is it a relief to
442	00:31:00.290	00:31:02.670	see him nominated from your point of view? For those
443	00:31:02.680	00:31:05.820	of us who cherish life and believe that it's immoral
444	00:31:05.830	00:31:09.300	and legally wrong to extinguish the lives of innocent children,
445	00:31:09.310	00:31:13.650	we are heartened by the nomination of Senator Ashcroft. He
446	00:31:13.660	00:31:16.290	is a man committed to the rule of law. I
447	00:31:16.300	00:31:19.500	expect that he will enforce the law and bring much
448	00:31:19.510	00:31:24.130	needed confidence back to the Justice Department which has been
449	00:31:24.140	00:31:28.550	grossly over-politicized during the Clinton administration. He's a person of
450	00:31:28.560	00:31:31.700	good will, which is not to be confused with a
451	00:31:31.710	00:31:35.660	lack of will. And I think it's very heartening to
452	00:31:35.670	00:31:40.100	people around the country who cherish life that a person
453	00:31:40.110	00:31:44.010	such as Senator Ashcroft, a distinguished lawyer, a distinguished statesman,
454	00:31:44.020	00:31:46.340	has been nominated for this position. When you say rule
455	00:31:46.350	00:31:49.080	of law, does that also extend in your opinion to
456	00:31:49.090	00:31:53.130	upholding Roe versus Wade? I think it extends to upholding
457	00:31:53.140	00:31:55.310	the laws that are on the books. I think it
458	00:31:55.320	00:31:59.750	extends to affirming the decisions that are in place, recognizing
459	00:31:59.760	00:32:04.270	that many of us believe that in Roe versus Wade
460	00:32:04.280	00:32:07.740	the Supreme Court of the United States hijacked the Constitution
461	00:32:07.750	00:32:11.280	and wrote law, made law from the bench rather than
462	00:32:11.290	00:32:14.920	followed the law. We would certainly hope that Senator Ashcroft,
463	00:32:14.930	00:32:17.960	in his new position, would recommend judges who would be
464	00:32:17.970	00:32:21.700	committed to interpreting the law and who would leave lawmaking
465	00:32:21.710	00:32:24.660	to the lawmakers. Kate Michelman, is John Ashcroft a threat
466	00:32:24.670	00:32:30.690	to abortion rights? No question. President-elect Bush couldn't have chosen
467	00:32:30.700	00:32:34.420	anyone, not anyone, more hostile to a woman's right to
468	00:32:34.430	00:32:38.600	choose than John Ashcroft. He has spent his entire public
469	00:32:38.610	00:32:44.560	career as Governor, as Attorney General, as Senator assaulting a
470	00:32:44.570	00:32:48.110	woman's right to choose, trying to undo Roe versus Wade.
471	00:32:48.120	00:32:51.940	I've heard a lot of discussion about his qualifications and
472	00:32:51.950	00:32:56.540	upholding the rule of law. Roe versus Wade recognized a
473	00:32:56.550	00:33:01.110	woman's constitutional right to privacy and reproductive freedom and choice.
474	00:33:01.120	00:33:04.400	Roe versus Wade stands as a monument to women's equality.
475	00:33:04.410	00:33:08.070	In fact, Justice Blackman, who wrote Roe, said over and
476	00:33:08.080	00:33:14.270	over again Roe was necessary as women continued their long
477	00:33:14.280	00:33:17.840	journey to full emancipation. It was right in 1973 and
478	00:33:17.850	00:33:21.940	it's right in 1994 when he said that and it's
479	00:33:21.950	00:33:26.840	right in 2001. John Ashcroft has done everything in his
480	00:33:26.850	00:33:29.450	power, in all of his public offices to take that
481	00:33:29.460	00:33:34.100	right away. In fact, he supports legislation that would define
482	00:33:34.110	00:33:39.890	life beginning at fertilization, which would not only criminalize all
483	00:33:39.900	00:33:43.630	abortions, take away a woman's right to reproductive freedom and
484	00:33:43.640	00:33:47.550	choice but would also outlaw and criminalize many forms of
485	00:33:47.560	00:33:52.000	the most common birth control options. This is a serious
486	00:33:52.010	00:34:00.380	opponent of women's constitutional and fundamental rights of choice. Yes,
487	00:34:00.390	00:34:03.790	he's qualified. He's qualified as the leader of those who
488	00:34:03.800	00:34:06.810	want to dismantle Roe versus Wade and take women back
489	00:34:06.820	00:34:09.780	to a day when they had no control over their
490	00:34:09.790	00:34:13.080	lives and, in fact, when their lives and health were
491	00:34:13.090	00:34:16.860	endangered. Clint Bolick--I think it might be important to
492	00:34:16.870	00:34:20.090	remember that the Dred Scott decision was once the law
493	00:34:20.100	00:34:23.630	of the land. Plessy versus Ferguson was once the law
494	00:34:23.640	00:34:26.230	of the land, but that didn't mean the law wasn't
495	00:34:26.240	00:34:29.530	capable of evolution to come up with a better sense
496	00:34:29.540	00:34:31.930	of what was fair and just. I believe you can
497	00:34:31.940	00:34:35.970	expect Senator Ashcroft to enforce the rule of law and
498	00:34:35.980	00:34:40.230	to work through the appropriate processes to encourage a change
499	00:34:40.240	00:34:45.570	in the law to yield a fair and just result
500	00:34:45.580	00:34:49.860	for innocent unborn children. What we're being told clearly is
501	00:34:49.870	00:34:52.630	that you're talking about activists. What we are going to
502	00:34:52.640	00:35:00.050	have from an Attorney General-elect Ashcroft is a wholesale assault
503	00:35:00.060	00:35:03.360	on existing civil rights principles. That is as clear as
504	00:35:03.370	00:35:09.170	a bell. Now, Senator Ashcroft is reported to have said--
505	00:35:09.180	00:35:11.250	and I don't know whether I have to double check
506	00:35:11.260	00:35:13.640	this--he's reported to have said at one time--I
507	00:35:13.650	00:35:15.930	don't know whether he was in jest or not--that
508	00:35:15.940	00:35:20.140	saying the only things in the middle of the road
509	00:35:20.150	00:35:23.610	are a moderate and a dead skunk. I said, well,
510	00:35:23.620	00:35:25.920	there's something else in the middle road. And something else
511	00:35:25.930	00:35:28.590	in the middle of the road is a white line
512	00:35:28.600	00:35:31.230	down the middle of the road. And the people of
513	00:35:31.240	00:35:33.610	the United States expect the Attorney General to be right
514	00:35:33.620	00:35:38.240	there on that line. Just one moment. Clint Bolick just
515	00:35:38.250	00:35:41.490	said, he talked about the fact that Ronnie White had
516	00:35:41.500	00:35:44.570	been opposed by many people--Ronnie White, the African-American jurist
517	00:35:44.580	00:35:46.050	in Missouri. What's your response to that? I did not
518	00:35:46.060	00:35:49.860	raise the issue of the federal judicial appointments. That is
519	00:35:49.870	00:35:52.380	a frightening thing when you look at the whole question
520	00:35:52.390	00:35:55.250	of the Attorney General of the United States and the
521	00:35:55.260	00:35:58.330	Department of Justice as a gatekeeper to the federal bench.
522	00:35:58.340	00:36:01.750	That's what it is. It's where judges come in for
523	00:36:01.760	00:36:06.110	their questioning. It's where the selection begins. Ronnie White was
524	00:36:06.120	00:36:09.050	the first African-American jurist on the Supreme Court of Missouri,
525	00:36:09.060	00:36:13.150	well regarded, well respected. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted him
526	00:36:13.160	00:36:19.250	out overwhelmingly. And 17 months later here comes Senator Ashcroft
527	00:36:19.260	00:36:24.120	ambushing the man arguing that the man was soft on
528	00:36:24.130	00:36:27.760	crime and pro death penalty when the facts are that
529	00:36:27.770	00:36:31.220	of the 59 death penalty cases that this Judge Ronnie
530	00:36:31.230	00:36:34.000	White had, 41 of them he affirmed. I mean it
531	00:36:34.010	00:36:38.790	was an ambush. And Clint talks about the 55 Senators.
532	00:36:38.800	00:36:42.300	Senator Ashcroft went to the Republican caucus and for his
533	00:36:42.310	00:36:46.850	own political partisan purposes he persuaded the Republican caucus to
534	00:36:46.860	00:36:50.200	vote against Ronnie White on purely a partisan political...Elaine
535	00:36:50.210	00:36:54.280	just said something that I really love about John Ashcroft,
536	00:36:54.290	00:36:56.890	and that makes him almost unique here in Washington and
537	00:36:56.900	00:36:59.110	that is he is a guy who fights for what
538	00:36:59.120	00:37:02.880	he believes in. When John Ashcroft gives you his word,
539	00:37:02.890	00:37:05.880	he is going to keep his word. I think that's
540	00:37:05.890	00:37:08.830	the sort of thing that we need more of in
541	00:37:08.840	00:37:12.760	Washington and certainly need in an Attorney General. But what
542	00:37:12.770	00:37:15.850	Elaine just does not like is that the law of
543	00:37:15.860	00:37:18.180	the land is not where she wants it to be.
544	00:37:18.190	00:37:22.140	The law of the land is that racial discrimination is
545	00:37:22.150	00:37:27.060	wrong, regardless of whether it's called benign or...What was
546	00:37:27.070	00:37:31.610	racially discriminatory in the Ronnie White selection? There was nothing
547	00:37:31.620	00:37:36.380	discriminatory in that selection. John Ashcroft as Governor appointed the
548	00:37:36.390	00:37:41.790	first African-American Judge to the Western District Court of Appeals.
549	00:37:41.800	00:37:44.440	As I said he voted for the vast majority of
550	00:37:44.450	00:37:48.680	minority nominees. This is race-baiting pure and simple. It is
551	00:37:48.690	00:37:51.470	an effort on the part of the left wing and
552	00:37:51.480	00:37:55.820	the Democratic Party to inflame the base by injecting race.
553	00:37:55.830	00:37:59.640	Ashcroft opposed a lot of nominees because he disagreed with
554	00:37:59.650	00:38:02.230	them fundamentally on their view of the law not because
555	00:38:02.240	00:38:04.720	of their race. Ken Conner, among the other things John
556	00:38:04.730	00:38:07.810	Ashcroft opposed as Senator was his notion of buffer zones
557	00:38:07.820	00:38:11.460	around abortion clinics or at least a buffer zone which
558	00:38:11.470	00:38:13.650	would allow protesters to have to maintain a certain amount
559	00:38:13.660	00:38:16.750	of distance. Do you imagine as Attorney General he would
560	00:38:16.760	00:38:19.940	be able to affect that, would be able to repeal
561	00:38:19.950	00:38:23.460	that, would have some effect? Would you want him to?
562	00:38:23.470	00:38:25.930	I expect that he would enforce the existing law, and
563	00:38:25.940	00:38:28.500	we would hope that he would work to change the
564	00:38:28.510	00:38:31.840	existing law. Certainly, I think there are many, many people
565	00:38:31.850	00:38:35.680	around the country, many First Amendment scholars included, who believe
566	00:38:35.690	00:38:39.240	that the buffer zone requirements represent an abridgement of free
567	00:38:39.250	00:38:43.060	speech. And so I expect in Senator Ashcroft that you'll
568	00:38:43.070	00:38:46.470	find a man who committed to the rule of law
569	00:38:46.480	00:38:49.360	will work to enforce the existing law and at the
570	00:38:49.370	00:38:52.200	same time where the administration disagrees with the law as
571	00:38:52.210	00:38:56.260	it currently exists to follow the proper processes to build
572	00:38:56.270	00:39:00.370	the public and legislative consensus to pass laws that more
573	00:39:00.380	00:39:02.950	nearly equate with what's fair and just. How much pressure
574	00:39:02.960	00:39:05.380	are you prepared to put on the Justice Department to
575	00:39:05.390	00:39:08.810	change those laws? Well, we certainly intend to lobby the
576	00:39:08.820	00:39:14.230	administration and the Congress, the administrative agencies, to change laws
577	00:39:14.240	00:39:17.220	that we think are unfair and unjust. We believe it
578	00:39:17.230	00:39:21.000	to be wrong that innocent children are killed in this
579	00:39:21.010	00:39:24.630	country to the tune of about 1,400,000 every year. We
580	00:39:24.640	00:39:28.460	think that's a grave wrong in this country. And we
581	00:39:28.470	00:39:31.540	look forward to judges who will interpret the law, who
582	00:39:31.550	00:39:34.540	will interpret the Constitution, and not use the bench as
583	00:39:34.550	00:39:38.290	a vehicle for advancing their own political or personal or
584	00:39:38.300	00:39:42.550	philosophical agendas. We believe that judges who strictly construe the
585	00:39:42.560	00:39:47.220	Constitution in accordance with the intent of the Founders will
586	00:39:47.230	00:39:51.360	do away ultimately in the final analysis with this law
587	00:39:51.370	00:39:55.210	called Roe versus Wade, which has resulted in extermination of
588	00:39:55.220	00:39:59.010	42 million children since it was first passed by the
589	00:39:59.020	00:40:01.490	Supreme Court of the United States. Kate Michelman, are you
590	00:40:01.500	00:40:04.180	gearing up for a big fight on this? Absolutely. The
591	00:40:04.190	00:40:05.960	future of a woman's right to choose, the future of
592	00:40:05.970	00:40:10.210	a woman's equality is on the line here. President-elect Bush,
593	00:40:10.220	00:40:14.730	I must admit I was a bit startled by the
594	00:40:14.740	00:40:20.000	nomination in this respect. He campaigned hard to convince people
595	00:40:20.010	00:40:24.250	who were pro-choice, especially pro-choice women, that he was moderate
596	00:40:24.260	00:40:29.570	on these issues. And in one bold, dramatic fell swoop
597	00:40:29.580	00:40:33.490	he sort of cracked his facade and showed his intent
598	00:40:33.500	00:40:35.250	to do away with a woman's right to choose by
599	00:40:35.260	00:40:39.450	putting in place one of the most hostile to women's
600	00:40:39.460	00:40:43.590	rights, people he could find to lead the Justice Department.
601	00:40:43.600	00:40:46.880	I want to go back to something Elaine said. This
602	00:40:46.890	00:40:51.560	Attorney General role has a prominent position in the cabinet
603	00:40:51.570	00:40:54.310	as a whole. It is influential in domestic policy as
604	00:40:54.320	00:41:01.970	a whole--vets the Supreme Court Justice nominations, other federal
605	00:41:01.980	00:41:06.690	nominations; advises the President on federal legislation, advises the President
606	00:41:06.700	00:41:13.010	in numerous ways. This nomination poses an enormous threat to
607	00:41:13.020	00:41:17.420	rights that women took a century to gain. And I
608	00:41:17.430	00:41:19.410	think it's a harbinger of things to come in terms
609	00:41:19.420	00:41:22.160	of the kinds of appointments that George Bush is going
610	00:41:22.170	00:41:30.460	to make to satisfy those hardliners who helped him get
611	00:41:30.470	00:41:34.150	elected, helped bring votes to him. And I might add
612	00:41:34.160	00:41:37.440	that the President-elect has no mandate to take away a
613	00:41:37.450	00:41:42.420	woman's right to choose. People who voted...more people voted
614	00:41:42.430	00:41:46.190	for a pro-choice candidate than for an anti-choice candidate. So
615	00:41:46.200	00:41:49.570	with this nomination I think the President has laid the
616	00:41:49.580	00:41:52.650	gauntlet down. I think that John Ashcroft can be counted
617	00:41:52.660	00:41:57.470	on to not necessarily enforce the law but to try
618	00:41:57.480	00:42:01.620	to undo the law that protects a woman's fundamental right
619	00:42:01.630	00:42:05.180	to choose. Elaine Jones. And Clint Bolick just made the
620	00:42:05.190	00:42:08.190	point that John Ashcroft believes in the point and will
621	00:42:08.200	00:42:10.710	drive it home. I say yes to the point of
622	00:42:10.720	00:42:15.120	inflexibility. He has a belief. But it's a Republican President
623	00:42:15.130	00:42:17.540	that is making Republican appointments. Yes. Yes. What can you
624	00:42:17.550	00:42:19.570	do to stop that? And a Republican President has every
625	00:42:19.580	00:42:24.560	right to make a conservative appointment. A Democratic President can
626	00:42:24.570	00:42:27.920	make a conservative appointment. That is why I am saying
627	00:42:27.930	00:42:31.130	that John Ashcroft is outside of that mold. He is
628	00:42:31.140	00:42:33.440	much too far, he's not in the middle of the
629	00:42:33.450	00:42:36.080	road. He's not a little bit over to the right.
630	00:42:36.090	00:42:39.900	He defines on this issue one who has made up
631	00:42:39.910	00:42:43.540	his mind on, you know, there's a right way to
632	00:42:43.550	00:42:46.140	go on these issues and all of our laws that
633	00:42:46.150	00:42:49.300	we have carefully put together for the past 35 years
634	00:42:49.310	00:42:51.070	can be up for grabs. A response, Clint Bolick. My
635	00:42:51.080	00:42:53.590	My fondest hope is that you will spend a tremendous
636	00:42:53.600	00:42:56.360	amount of capital and energy on this because at the
637	00:42:56.370	00:42:58.890	end of the day John Ashcroft will be confirmed. There's
638	00:42:58.900	00:43:02.580	no surprise that Governor Bush has chosen John Ashcroft as
639	00:43:02.590	00:43:08.010	his Attorney General. Governor Bush was a law-and-order Governor in
640	00:43:08.020	00:43:10.720	Texas. He believes in the rule of law, so too
641	00:43:10.730	00:43:14.630	does John Ashcroft. I said that he keeps his promises.
642	00:43:14.640	00:43:17.620	The most sacred promise that he will make is his
643	00:43:17.630	00:43:20.110	oath to uphold the law of the land, when he's
644	00:43:20.120	00:43:23.800	sworn in as Attorney General. Unlike the last eight years
645	00:43:23.810	00:43:25.810	I think we'll have an Attorney General who will actually
646	00:43:25.820	00:43:30.740	do that. As Clint does, I say the U.S. Senate
647	00:43:30.750	00:43:33.220	will hear us and they will vote on the basis
648	00:43:33.230	00:43:35.140	of what they hear. Well, as Ray Suarez says, I
649	00:43:35.150	00:43:37.550	can tell that the fax machines are heating up. Thank
650	00:43:37.560	00:43:49.530	you all very much. A second look now at a
651	00:43:49.540	00:43:52.960	story we aired after last summer's Middle East peace negotiations
652	00:43:52.970	00:43:56.750	at Camp David. In August, Elizabeth Farnsworth traveled to Israel,
653	00:43:56.760	00:43:58.860	the West Bank and Gaza to look at some of
654	00:43:58.870	00:44:01.760	the key issues. Here is her report on the debate
655	00:44:01.770	00:44:06.110	over the right of return for Palestinian refugees, an increasingly
656	00:44:06.120	00:44:13.000	contentious negotiating point in the latest Middle East peace talks.
657	00:44:13.010	00:44:16.320	These are the faces of Palestinian refugees whose fate is
658	00:44:16.330	00:44:23.060	at stake in peace negotiations underway now. Rasslan Sukkar fled
659	00:44:23.070	00:44:26.780	Jaffa in what is now Israel in 1948 when he
660	00:44:26.790	00:44:30.090	was twelve years old. His wife left Jaffa as a
661	00:44:30.100	00:44:38.360	child too. They, their children, and grandchildren--three generations--have
662	00:44:38.370	00:44:41.100	lived most of their lives in a refugee camp in
663	00:44:41.110	00:44:48.690	Gaza. They live in this house in the "Beach Camp,"
664	00:44:48.700	00:44:51.380	as it is known. It is a small city now,
665	00:44:51.390	00:44:55.500	with more than 75,000 people. The United Nations has helped
666	00:44:55.510	00:44:59.690	refugees construct houses here, building up, not out, because of
667	00:44:59.700	00:45:03.860	limited space. This is one of the most densely populated
668	00:45:03.870	00:45:07.980	areas on earth--and one of the poorest. The annual
669	00:45:07.990	00:45:15.340	per capita income here is $800. 34 Sukkars live in
670	00:45:15.350	00:45:19.020	this three-story house. They all say the main thing they
671	00:45:19.030	00:45:22.700	want from peace negotiations is simply to go back home
672	00:45:22.710	00:45:27.210	to Jaffa. And that is a desire Israeli negotiators have
673	00:45:27.220	00:45:32.250	opposed. The places refugees like the Sukkars consider home, are
674	00:45:32.260	00:45:36.800	mostly inhabited by Jewish Israelis now, many of them refugees
675	00:45:36.810	00:45:41.150	from Europe and the Middle East. Yuli Tamir is a
676	00:45:41.160	00:45:44.430	member of the cabinet of Prime Minister Ehud Barak: Can
677	00:45:44.440	00:45:47.120	you imagine now a Jewish move back to Europe, saying
678	00:45:47.130	00:45:51.110	to people in Poland, or in Germany or in Czechoslovakia,
679	00:45:51.120	00:45:55.290	go back, leave your houses--these were our houses? In
680	00:45:55.300	00:45:58.970	Gaza, the Sukkar family gathered to explain their desire to
681	00:45:58.980	00:46:05.940	go home. We are determined...if it's not us, it's
682	00:46:05.950	00:46:10.100	the sons of our sons--one day they can go
683	00:46:10.110	00:46:14.310	back. Rasslan Sukkar's father was a manager of stevedores at
684	00:46:14.320	00:46:18.450	the Jaffa Harbor until 1948 when the family fled the
685	00:46:18.460	00:46:21.210	chaos of the war that followed the declaration of the
686	00:46:21.220	00:46:30.220	Jewish State in Palestine. In 1948 because of the war,
687	00:46:30.230	00:46:35.450	we had to leave there to emigrate through Egypt; and
688	00:46:35.460	00:46:39.650	after two years there we had to come to live
689	00:46:39.660	00:46:44.740	in Gaza. The UN was the only organization helping; otherwise
690	00:46:44.750	00:46:51.530	a lot of people would have been dead by now.
691	00:46:51.540	00:46:54.170	I remember when I left Jaffa I was seven years
692	00:46:54.180	00:46:58.190	old. My father was always telling us tomorrow, next month,
693	00:46:58.200	00:47:02.240	next year, and until now look what happened to us...
694	00:47:02.250	00:47:09.250	we didn't go nowhere. You still have your key? I
695	00:47:09.260	00:47:16.060	remember my aunt at that time, my husband's mother, when
696	00:47:16.070	00:47:19.390	we were leaving, she locked the door and put it
697	00:47:19.400	00:47:28.140	around her neck. When I look at this key, I
698	00:47:28.150	00:47:31.580	say where am I from? Fifty years I'm waiting to
699	00:47:31.590	00:47:39.400	go back to my Palestinian soil in Jaffa. Jaffa, which
700	00:47:39.410	00:47:42.970	is just south of Tel Aviv, lies tantalizingly close to
701	00:47:42.980	00:47:46.370	the Sukkars' Gaza home--a 40 mile drive up the
702	00:47:46.380	00:47:51.060	Mediterranean coast. The family has returned to Jaffa occasionally, but
703	00:47:51.070	00:47:53.740	they need a special permit from the Israelis to cross
704	00:47:53.750	00:47:58.150	the border, and it is often refused. Standing here next
705	00:47:58.160	00:48:01.130	to the ancient port of Jaffa, it's easy to understand
706	00:48:01.140	00:48:04.840	why refugees like the Sukkars want so intensely to return.
707	00:48:04.850	00:48:08.390	They remember this beautiful light, the graceful homes, the fragrance
708	00:48:08.400	00:48:11.830	of orchards that used to surround the city. Even Palestinians
709	00:48:11.840	00:48:14.840	who didn't flee, who are still here, remember the old
710	00:48:14.850	00:48:23.800	times with longing. One of those Palestinians is Fakhri Geday,
711	00:48:23.810	00:48:26.250	a pharmacist who is writing a history of the Arab
712	00:48:26.260	00:48:31.460	community here. On a tour, Geday described what Jaffa was
713	00:48:31.470	00:48:35.430	like before the 1948 fighting drove people like the Sukkars
714	00:48:35.440	00:48:39.120	out. The city was mainly Arab, he said, but with
715	00:48:39.130	00:48:44.190	many Jews. Of more than 65,000 Arabs in 1948; all
716	00:48:44.200	00:48:47.680	but a few thousand fled. Jaffa is part of Tel
717	00:48:47.690	00:48:54.370	Aviv now and is mostly Jewish-Israeli. Geday said 75 percent
718	00:48:54.380	00:48:57.570	of the old Arab buildings in Jaffa, including the Sukkars'
719	00:48:57.580	00:49:01.240	home, have been destroyed. Those that remain are much in
720	00:49:01.250	00:49:05.950	demand now, and some are being restored. This building used
721	00:49:05.960	00:49:09.160	to be an Arab building. It was bought by a
722	00:49:09.170	00:49:16.290	Jewish lawyer, who is my friend, Sewkawalski. And he repaired
723	00:49:16.300	00:49:24.640	it and is now renting it. Israeli artist Etti Barchil
724	00:49:24.650	00:49:26.780	has been a leader in the effort to protect the
725	00:49:26.790	00:49:31.450	old Arab homes. She and her husband restored this 150-year-old
726	00:49:31.460	00:49:37.470	house themselves. Her family fled anti-Jewish persecution in Iran in
727	00:49:37.480	00:49:42.540	1949. She has little sympathy for the Palestinian refugees' desire
728	00:49:42.550	00:49:48.100	to return. The truth is I cannot blame people who
729	00:49:48.110	00:49:51.690	fled out of fear, I cannot judge them, but the
730	00:49:51.700	00:49:54.260	fact is that a lot of people stayed. Over a
731	00:49:54.270	00:49:57.940	million people in Israel today are Palestinian Arabs who chose
732	00:49:57.950	00:50:01.020	to stay. I have no problem with that. But we
733	00:50:01.030	00:50:04.700	were forced to flee, and that's important to emphasize. We've
734	00:50:04.710	00:50:07.070	got a small piece of land, damn it! Let us
735	00:50:07.080	00:50:13.240	live! Gaby Aldor also lives in a restored Arab home.
736	00:50:13.250	00:50:15.800	She bought it from the Israeli Housing Authority, which took
737	00:50:15.810	00:50:21.170	over abandoned Arab properties after 1948. Some of Aldor's family
738	00:50:21.180	00:50:24.320	came from Europe in the early 20th century, some later,
739	00:50:24.330	00:50:28.820	fleeing the Holocaust. She's a choreographer/director who has produced a
740	00:50:28.830	00:50:33.730	much-awarded theater piece about the overlapping claims in this city.
741	00:50:33.740	00:50:36.590	How do you justify living in a home that, that
742	00:50:36.600	00:50:39.880	perhaps belongs to somebody else? Well, it's the same as
743	00:50:39.890	00:50:44.930	I can't justify or not justify the fact that somebody's
744	00:50:44.940	00:50:47.820	living in my father's house in Vienna. I mean this
745	00:50:47.830	00:50:51.480	is really the tragedy of history. In this century people
746	00:50:51.490	00:50:55.320	have been moved, people move. So what I can do
747	00:50:55.330	00:50:59.530	is recognize their pain and say yes, it is painful...
748	00:50:59.540	00:51:03.960	you can't really emotionally say "Okay, the Palestinians, there was
749	00:51:03.970	00:51:07.130	something wrong done to them..." because you can't cut it
750	00:51:07.140	00:51:09.890	off from the history of the whole era; and the
751	00:51:09.900	00:51:16.140	whole era's history is awful. In Aldor's play, the protagonist,
752	00:51:16.150	00:51:20.190	like the Sukkars, long to go home. In my play,
753	00:51:20.200	00:51:22.670	the guy has a key, but as a matter of
754	00:51:22.680	00:51:28.320	fact, no one can come back because there is no
755	00:51:28.330	00:51:33.100	way back. So I understand his longing. But my father
756	00:51:33.110	00:51:36.150	was longing, all his life, to Vienna. There is no
757	00:51:36.160	00:51:40.680	way back, ever. I'm, okay, I say "You're welcome. Come
758	00:51:40.690	00:51:47.820	here." Where do I go? Vienna? I'm not wanted there.
759	00:51:47.830	00:51:52.020	Gaby Aldor said this issue is especially sensitive because Israelis
760	00:51:52.030	00:51:56.150	in Jaffa and elsewhere worry a Palestinian Right of Return
761	00:51:56.160	00:52:01.050	threatens Israel's existence as a Jewish State. Cabinet member Tamir
762	00:52:01.060	00:52:07.060	explained. For us, the main motivation for the peace process,
763	00:52:07.070	00:52:10.540	apart from living in peace with our neighbors, is that
764	00:52:10.550	00:52:14.360	we would like to have a state which is a
765	00:52:14.370	00:52:18.580	Jewish state, that has mainly a Jewish majority. And at
766	00:52:18.590	00:52:20.490	the moment I don't think that the Middle East is
767	00:52:20.500	00:52:26.210	ripe for some sort of mingling of populations and if
768	00:52:26.220	00:52:29.360	the refugees will come back to the territory of Israel,
769	00:52:29.370	00:52:33.050	Israel will turn into a binational state. Well, see that's
770	00:52:33.060	00:52:36.610	part of the process of negotiations where you try to
771	00:52:36.620	00:52:46.270	intimidate the other side by making justice so catastrophic to
772	00:52:46.280	00:52:50.410	your side that it is unthinkable. Salim Tamari is a
773	00:52:50.420	00:52:54.940	Palestinian sociologist who has been closely involved in negotiations on
774	00:52:54.950	00:52:57.900	the refugee issue. He has pushed for the Right of
775	00:52:57.910	00:53:02.070	Return as an essential component of a just peace. His
776	00:53:02.080	00:53:06.220	old home in Jaffa has become a drug rehabilitation center.
777	00:53:06.230	00:53:08.540	He would like it returned to his family, at least
778	00:53:08.550	00:53:12.670	in principal; but says they probably wouldn't go back. The
779	00:53:12.680	00:53:14.870	Right of Return does not mean the practice of the
780	00:53:14.880	00:53:18.310	right of return by four and a half million refugees.
781	00:53:18.320	00:53:22.060	It means the refugees have the principle right to return
782	00:53:22.070	00:53:26.300	as a choice and then the modalities of return will
783	00:53:26.310	00:53:30.340	have to be negotiated with the Israelis. In this respect
784	00:53:30.350	00:53:34.150	I think the same advice I'm giving the Palestinians, I'm
785	00:53:34.160	00:53:38.490	giving also to our own people: you cannot turn the
786	00:53:38.500	00:53:41.430	historical wheel backwards, and if you do it, it will
787	00:53:41.440	00:53:46.580	just cause disaster. Imagine if all the Jewish refugees that
788	00:53:46.590	00:53:49.600	came here from the Arab world would now say, "Okay,
789	00:53:49.610	00:53:53.270	we want to go back to Morocco or Tunisia or
790	00:53:53.280	00:53:56.140	Algeria or to Syria, or to Egypt. I think this
791	00:53:56.150	00:54:01.920	will destabilize the area to an enormous extent. While experts
792	00:54:01.930	00:54:06.180	and negotiators debate, researchers at the "Orient House," the headquarters
793	00:54:06.190	00:54:10.160	of the Palestinian leadership in East Jerusalem, are working to
794	00:54:10.170	00:54:16.280	document Arab holdings confiscated by Israelis since 1948. Using records
795	00:54:16.290	00:54:18.820	going back to the Ottoman Empire and the years when
796	00:54:18.830	00:54:23.580	the British ruled, geographers are painstakingly identifying ownership of Arab
797	00:54:23.590	00:54:28.470	homes and lands then and now. In the past, Palestinian
798	00:54:28.480	00:54:34.710	negotiators had resisted discussing compensation; but it is very much
799	00:54:34.720	00:54:37.660	on the table now, Tamari says. Compensation is being considered
800	00:54:37.670	00:54:40.130	now as part of a package which includes the right
801	00:54:40.140	00:54:49.660	of return, repatriation, resettlement and restitution. Now compensation is acceptable
802	00:54:49.670	00:54:52.300	only within this context because it will have to include,
803	00:54:52.310	00:54:55.890	for example, notions of restitution, which means people who had
804	00:54:55.900	00:54:58.590	property, at least some of them, will be able to
805	00:54:58.600	00:55:02.160	claim their property back. The Israelis have their own proposals
806	00:55:02.170	00:55:08.230	too...First of all, Israel insists it will not recognize
807	00:55:08.240	00:55:12.040	the right of return to the sovereign territory of the
808	00:55:12.050	00:55:17.720	state of Israel; however, we are trying to put together
809	00:55:17.730	00:55:22.420	a package deal that will alleviate the pain and suffering
810	00:55:22.430	00:55:25.820	of the Palestinian refugees. We will also take into account
811	00:55:25.830	00:55:30.250	that Israel itself has absorbed many Jewish refugees from the
812	00:55:30.260	00:55:33.320	Arab world, from all around the world, and we'll try
813	00:55:33.330	00:55:37.700	to work for the benefit of those individuals. Specifically, there
814	00:55:37.710	00:55:41.400	was talk at Camp David about setting up an international
815	00:55:41.410	00:55:45.480	consortium which would administer a multibillion dollar fund to provide
816	00:55:45.490	00:55:50.120	compensation to Palestinians refugees and perhaps to Jewish refugees from
817	00:55:50.130	00:55:53.430	Arab countries too. The money would come from the United
818	00:55:53.440	00:55:58.770	States, Europe and other countries. No one can say at
819	00:55:58.780	00:56:01.120	this point what a peace agreement might mean for the
820	00:56:01.130	00:56:04.440	Sukkar family in Gaza. They have heard they may be
821	00:56:04.450	00:56:08.030	offered compensation instead of the right of return, but they
822	00:56:08.040	00:56:14.290	know nothing is definite. They want to give compensation, look,
823	00:56:14.300	00:56:16.340	I mean, to give me back my land is cheaper
824	00:56:16.350	00:56:18.010	for them than to give me money; I want my
825	00:56:18.020	00:56:24.190	land. You know, to give me compensation my suffering--my
826	00:56:24.200	00:56:28.060	suffering is in my heart; it will not go away.
827	00:56:28.070	00:56:31.320	Since that report was prepared, renewed violence in Gaza, the
828	00:56:31.330	00:56:34.900	West Bank and in Israel has cost more than 300
829	00:56:34.910	00:56:46.200	lives, mostly Palestinian. Again, the major stories of this Tuesday,
830	00:56:46.210	00:56:50.860	President-elect Bush rounded out his cabinet with nominees for transportation,
831	00:56:50.870	00:56:55.360	labor and energy. And Palestinian leader Arafat met with President
832	00:56:55.370	00:56:58.220	Clinton at the White House. They discussed the latest U.S.
833	00:56:58.230	00:57:01.690	proposals for a Middle East peace settlement. We'll see you
834	00:57:01.700	00:57:05.820	online, and again here tomorrow evening. I'm Gwen Ifill, thank
835	00:57:05.830	01:04:07.198	you and good night.
