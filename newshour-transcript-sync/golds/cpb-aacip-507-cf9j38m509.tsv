1	00:00:24.130	00:00:27.050	Good evening. I'm Jim Lehrer. On the NewsHour tonight: The
2	00:00:27.060	00:00:31.120	news of this day; then the president's new budget proposal,
3	00:00:31.130	00:00:35.900	with differing reactions from Senators Judd Gregg and Kent Conrad;
4	00:00:35.910	00:00:39.350	an update report on peace progress between Israel and the
5	00:00:39.360	00:00:43.330	Palestinians; a health unit look at ways to prevent deadly
6	00:00:43.340	00:00:48.030	medical errors; and some thoughts from sports author John Feinstein
7	00:00:48.040	00:02:24.420	about the varied meanings of the Super Bowl. President Bush
8	00:02:24.430	00:02:28.320	sent his 2006 budget to Congress today. It marked the
9	00:02:28.330	00:02:32.470	opening of a major battle over federal priorities. The budget
10	00:02:32.480	00:02:36.560	totaled more than $2.5 trillion, with a record deficit of
11	00:02:36.570	00:02:41.890	$427 billion. Overall, it would boost spending for defense and
12	00:02:41.900	00:02:46.690	homeland security, but cut scores of other programs. The president
13	00:02:46.700	00:02:50.610	said it sets priorities in a fiscally responsible way. House
14	00:02:50.620	00:02:54.240	Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called it a "hoax" because the
15	00:02:54.250	00:02:58.630	costs of Iraq and Social Security changes were not included.
16	00:02:58.640	00:03:01.140	We'll have our full coverage of the story right after
17	00:03:01.150	00:03:05.490	this News Summary. Israel and the Palestinians announced plans today
18	00:03:05.500	00:03:09.760	for a formal ceasefire, to end four years of violence.
19	00:03:09.770	00:03:14.420	Palestinian President Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Sharon will formally
20	00:03:14.430	00:03:18.070	declare the truce tomorrow at a summit in Egypt. An
21	00:03:18.080	00:03:21.100	Israeli representative said it's the first step in getting back
22	00:03:21.110	00:03:25.030	on track toward a peace agreement. Declarations in and by
23	00:03:25.040	00:03:28.910	themself are not sufficient but I think this time the
24	00:03:28.920	00:03:32.530	declaration has substance behind it because I think both sides--
25	00:03:32.540	00:03:35.320	the Israelis and the Palestinians--are very serious in an
26	00:03:35.330	00:03:39.670	effort not to lose this opportunity and to move forward.
27	00:03:39.680	00:03:43.550	The Palestinians said the deal also calls for joint committees
28	00:03:43.560	00:03:47.760	to oversee Israeli pullbacks in the West Bank. The announcement
29	00:03:47.770	00:03:51.350	came after U.S. Secretary of State Rice visited the region.
30	00:03:51.360	00:03:55.110	She said President Abbas and Prime Minister Sharon will meet
31	00:03:55.120	00:03:58.440	separately with President Bush in Washington. And she said the
32	00:03:58.450	00:04:02.830	U.S. wants to seize the moment. I'm here in my
33	00:04:02.840	00:04:06.580	first ten or so days as secretary of state to
34	00:04:06.590	00:04:12.100	demonstrate that commitment. Not everything has to involve the United
35	00:04:12.110	00:04:15.480	States, but the United States has to be there when
36	00:04:15.490	00:04:19.810	it is needed. We will be very active. We'll have
37	00:04:19.820	00:04:22.780	more on this story later in the program. At least
38	00:04:22.790	00:04:25.740	28 people died in a series of attacks across Iraq
39	00:04:25.750	00:04:29.780	today. In Baqubah, a car bomb killed at least 15
40	00:04:29.790	00:04:34.470	people outside a police building. In Mosul, a suicide bomber
41	00:04:34.480	00:04:38.990	killed 12 policemen at a hospital compound. Another person died
42	00:04:39.000	00:04:42.630	in a mortar attack in Mosul. And over the weekend,
43	00:04:42.640	00:04:47.890	insurgents killed at least 21 Iraqis and three U.S. soldiers.
44	00:04:47.900	00:04:50.760	A Kurdish coalition moved into second place today, in the
45	00:04:50.770	00:04:54.840	vote count in Iraq. A Shiite alliance, backed by Grand
46	00:04:54.850	00:04:59.160	Ayatollah al-Sistani, remained in first place with well over two
47	00:04:59.170	00:05:02.480	million votes. The Kurdish grouping of two parties had more
48	00:05:02.490	00:05:05.240	than one million votes and a bloc headed by Prime
49	00:05:05.250	00:05:10.390	Minister Allawi was running third. Returns so far have indicated
50	00:05:10.400	00:05:13.920	most Sunni Muslims did not vote. A final tally is
51	00:05:13.930	00:05:19.920	expected Thursday. U.N. Secretary-General Annan today suspended two top officials
52	00:05:19.930	00:05:24.080	involved in the oil-for-food program in Iraq. Last week, an
53	00:05:24.090	00:05:28.030	independent report accused the program's former head of a "grave
54	00:05:28.040	00:05:32.180	conflict of interest" in handling oil deals with Iraq. The
55	00:05:32.190	00:05:36.400	report also said another official, in charge of awarding contracts,
56	00:05:36.410	00:05:39.940	had tainted the process. The two men can appeal the
57	00:05:39.950	00:05:44.890	suspensions. A jury in Massachusetts today convicted a key figure
58	00:05:44.900	00:05:49.110	in the Catholic Church's sex abuse scandal. Defrocked priest Paul
59	00:05:49.120	00:05:52.930	Shanley was found guilty in Cambridge of raping a boy
60	00:05:52.940	00:05:57.350	in the 1980s. He showed no emotion as the verdict
61	00:05:57.360	00:06:00.920	was read. The abuse began when the victim was six
62	00:06:00.930	00:06:05.160	years old. He's now 27. Shanley is now 74. He
63	00:06:05.170	00:06:09.170	faces a possible life sentence. On Wall Street today, the
64	00:06:09.180	00:06:12.340	Dow Jones Industrial Average lost less than one point to
65	00:06:12.350	00:06:17.180	close at 10,715. The NASDAQ fell four points to close
66	00:06:17.190	00:06:21.700	at 2082. The city of Boston geared up for another
67	00:06:21.710	00:06:24.630	victory parade today. This time it will be for the
68	00:06:24.640	00:06:28.010	New England Patriots' victory in the Super Bowl. They beat
69	00:06:28.020	00:06:33.670	the Philadelphia Eagles 24-21 on Sunday, in Jacksonville, Florida. It
70	00:06:33.680	00:06:37.930	was New England's third NFL championship in four years and
71	00:06:37.940	00:06:40.440	the second in a row. We'll have more on the
72	00:06:40.450	00:06:43.630	Super Bowl at the end of the program tonight. And
73	00:06:43.640	00:06:48.770	between now and then: the budget, Senators Gregg and Conrad,
74	00:06:48.780	00:07:03.990	a Middle East update, and medical errors. President Bush put
75	00:07:04.000	00:07:08.280	a proposed budget on the public and congressional table today.
76	00:07:08.290	00:07:16.220	Kwame Holman begins our coverage. Representing the House Budget Committee,
77	00:07:16.230	00:07:18.790	Kansas Republican Jim Ryun was one of the first to
78	00:07:18.800	00:07:21.120	receive a copy of the president's budget when they were
79	00:07:21.130	00:07:23.510	delivered to the capitol early this morning. A lot of
80	00:07:23.520	00:07:27.410	numbers, a lot of good reading. The nearly 2,500-page document
81	00:07:27.420	00:07:31.510	lays out more than $2.5 trillion of federal spending for
82	00:07:31.520	00:07:35.580	fiscal year 2006, and includes the first cut in basic
83	00:07:35.590	00:07:39.530	domestic programs since Ronald Reagan was president. Meeting with his
84	00:07:39.540	00:07:42.940	cabinet this morning, President Bush defended his budget. I fully
85	00:07:42.950	00:07:47.860	understand that sometimes it's hard to eliminate a program that
86	00:07:47.870	00:07:53.260	sounds good. But by getting people to focus on results
87	00:07:53.270	00:07:55.620	and saying to members of Congress, "show us the results
88	00:07:55.630	00:07:57.940	as to whether or not this program is working," I
89	00:07:57.950	00:08:01.280	think we'll get a pretty good response. Presidents send their
90	00:08:01.290	00:08:04.700	budgets to Congress early in February hoping to influence the
91	00:08:04.710	00:08:07.820	final legislative decisions members will make by the start of
92	00:08:07.830	00:08:12.000	the new fiscal year in October. And traditionally, members immediately
93	00:08:12.010	00:08:15.430	rate the proposals anywhere from "a good starting point" to
94	00:08:15.440	00:08:19.310	"dead on arrival." In that tradition, Senate Democratic leader Harry
95	00:08:19.320	00:08:23.010	Reid today called the president's budget "the most irresponsible and
96	00:08:23.020	00:08:26.980	misleading budget in our nation's history." And at his briefing
97	00:08:26.990	00:08:30.870	this afternoon, the president's budget director Josh Bolten said recent
98	00:08:30.880	00:08:33.860	history is on President Bush's side. I imagine that you
99	00:08:33.870	00:08:38.630	all have already gotten some "dead on arrival" comments from
100	00:08:38.640	00:08:41.680	folks on the Hill. The same thing was said last
101	00:08:41.690	00:08:45.300	year. In the end, the Congress delivered the totals that
102	00:08:45.310	00:08:47.840	the president sought. Now, a lot of the details are
103	00:08:47.850	00:08:53.830	different and that is Congress's responsibility to make appropriations decisions,
104	00:08:53.840	00:08:57.110	subject to the president's signature. The president's budget is a
105	00:08:57.120	00:09:00.020	blueprint of how much he wants the government to spend,
106	00:09:00.030	00:09:03.070	offset by how much revenue he expects it to collect.
107	00:09:03.080	00:09:06.790	But because spending once again will far exceed revenues, the
108	00:09:06.800	00:09:09.810	government will have to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars
109	00:09:09.820	00:09:13.240	to make up the difference. The projected deficit this year
110	00:09:13.250	00:09:18.860	alone is $427 billion. But Budget Director Bolten says if
111	00:09:18.870	00:09:22.810	Congress follows the president's budget proposals, annual deficits could be
112	00:09:22.820	00:09:26.620	cut in half by 2009, a promise made by the
113	00:09:26.630	00:09:29.220	president during last week's state of the union address. It’s
114	00:09:29.230	00:09:34.580	never unanimously popular to propose any savings. The spending is
115	00:09:34.590	00:09:36.950	in the budget for a reason, because somebody wanted it
116	00:09:36.960	00:09:41.270	there. But in an era of limited resources, we need
117	00:09:41.280	00:09:43.670	to set some priorities and I'm optimistic that we'll get
118	00:09:43.680	00:09:47.440	some good cooperation from the Congress. While defense and homeland
119	00:09:47.450	00:09:51.200	security are slated for large increases, the president's budget calls
120	00:09:51.210	00:09:56.680	for eliminating or drastically scaling back some 150 federal programs.
121	00:09:56.690	00:10:00.560	They include: Government support for farmers--price supports would be
122	00:10:00.570	00:10:04.410	reduced on a wide range of crops; federal grant programs
123	00:10:04.420	00:10:09.670	for local schools, vocational education, anti-drug efforts and literacy programs
124	00:10:09.680	00:10:13.260	would be cut back; Medicaid, which provides health care for
125	00:10:13.270	00:10:16.440	the poor, would have its growth restrained; the Army Corps
126	00:10:16.450	00:10:20.360	of Engineers, whose dam and waterway projects are extremely popular
127	00:10:20.370	00:10:23.170	in Congress, would receive less funding than it did in
128	00:10:23.180	00:10:29.070	2005; and federal subsidies for Amtrak's operation would be eliminated.
129	00:10:29.080	00:10:32.140	Today, Democrats said those cuts are the wrong way to
130	00:10:32.150	00:10:35.220	reduce the deficit. John Spratt of South Carolina is the
131	00:10:35.230	00:10:38.450	top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. They're real and
132	00:10:38.460	00:10:41.350	they hurt and yet for all of the hurt these
133	00:10:41.360	00:10:45.510	accounts hardly move deficit at all. This is the irony
134	00:10:45.520	00:10:48.120	of what they have proposed here as a budget solution.
135	00:10:48.130	00:10:50.790	These programs have proved themselves and they have stood the
136	00:10:50.800	00:10:54.710	test of time. Yet they're cutting them. We simply take
137	00:10:54.720	00:10:56.590	it back to the American people and throw it to
138	00:10:56.600	00:10:59.510	the Congress and say, "Is this really what you want
139	00:10:59.520	00:11:02.890	to buy into?" Democrats also argue that the president's plan
140	00:11:02.900	00:11:07.130	only achieves its deficit-reduction goals by leaving out big-ticket spending
141	00:11:07.140	00:11:09.960	items, such as the cost of keeping troops in Iraq
142	00:11:09.970	00:11:14.810	and Afghanistan, and paying for his top domestic priority, revamping
143	00:11:14.820	00:11:18.310	Social Security. Budget Director Bolten. The budget went to bed
144	00:11:18.320	00:11:22.460	a couple of weeks, two or three weeks ago and
145	00:11:22.470	00:11:27.200	so before the president's proposals were announced. And the president's
146	00:11:27.210	00:11:31.090	Social Security proposals are still in formulation, in a process
147	00:11:31.100	00:11:34.720	of consultation with the Congress. We're just reflecting now for
148	00:11:34.730	00:11:38.700	you what we do know about the immediate deficit effects
149	00:11:38.710	00:11:42.640	of the personal account formulation that the president advertised. There's
150	00:11:42.650	00:11:45.200	a lot more, though, to go to know what the
151	00:11:45.210	00:11:49.040	real numbers are going out into the future. Also left
152	00:11:49.050	00:11:51.540	out of the president's budget was the future cost of
153	00:11:51.550	00:11:55.850	making Mr. Bush's first-term tax cuts permanent. Democrats today said
154	00:11:55.860	00:11:59.420	those hidden costs will lead the nation further into debt.
155	00:11:59.430	00:12:02.010	North Dakota's Kent Conrad: He is taking us to a
156	00:12:02.020	00:12:05.950	future in which massive cuts will be required. There will
157	00:12:05.960	00:12:08.970	be massive cuts. I'm predicting today massive cuts in Social
158	00:12:08.980	00:12:13.300	Security, massive cuts in Medicare under this president's plan. He's
159	00:12:13.310	00:12:16.650	going to take us right over the cliff into massive
160	00:12:16.660	00:12:21.750	deficits and massive debt that will harm the American economy
161	00:12:21.760	00:12:24.660	for a long time to come. Congress begins the process
162	00:12:24.670	00:12:28.640	of examining the president's budget tomorrow, with hearings on both
163	00:12:28.650	00:12:32.150	the House and Senate sides of the Capitol. Margaret Warner
164	00:12:32.160	00:12:36.320	picks up the congressional debate over the new budget. And
165	00:12:36.330	00:12:38.600	for that I'm joined by the two Senate leaders who
166	00:12:38.610	00:12:41.460	have primary responsibility for dealing with the budget in the
167	00:12:41.470	00:12:44.460	months ahead. Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire is the
168	00:12:44.470	00:12:47.790	chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and Senator Kent Conrad
169	00:12:47.800	00:12:51.100	of North Dakota is the committee's ranking Democrat. Welcome to
170	00:12:51.110	00:12:55.090	you both. Senator Gregg, you expressed great support for this
171	00:12:55.100	00:12:57.690	budget today. You called it...you said the president should
172	00:12:57.700	00:13:00.880	be congratulated. What do you like about it? Well, I
173	00:13:00.890	00:13:02.850	like the fact that he's put forward a specific set
174	00:13:02.860	00:13:05.590	of ideas for restraining the growth of spending, both on
175	00:13:05.600	00:13:08.480	the discretionary side, and a large number of the entitlement
176	00:13:08.490	00:13:13.620	accounts, whether it's agriculture or Medicaid. On the discretionary side,
177	00:13:13.630	00:13:17.650	he's basically kept non-defense discretionary at a less than the
178	00:13:17.660	00:13:21.180	rate of inflation growth. On the defense side, he's actually
179	00:13:21.190	00:13:24.210	reduced the rate of growth of the base of defense.
180	00:13:24.220	00:13:29.290	So it's a pretty aggressive statement of trying to institute
181	00:13:29.300	00:13:33.740	some policies to discipline our fiscal house. And Senator Conrad,
182	00:13:33.750	00:13:37.410	you were, to say the least, not very complimentary. What
183	00:13:37.420	00:13:41.830	don't you like about it? I think this budget by
184	00:13:41.840	00:13:44.300	the president takes us just one more step down the
185	00:13:44.310	00:13:49.210	trail of record deficits and record debt, and debt and
186	00:13:49.220	00:13:54.910	deficits that explode as the president's proposals get enacted. You
187	00:13:54.920	00:13:57.080	know, he just left out a lot of things. When
188	00:13:57.090	00:13:58.880	he says he's going to cut the deficit in half
189	00:13:58.890	00:14:02.290	over the next five years, he left out war costs;
190	00:14:02.300	00:14:05.420	there's no war costs past September 30 of this year.
191	00:14:05.430	00:14:07.960	He left out the trillions of dollars that his Social
192	00:14:07.970	00:14:12.480	Security privatization plan will cost. He left out $700 billion
193	00:14:12.490	00:14:15.390	needed to fix the alternative minimum cost. Minimum tax. He
194	00:14:15.400	00:14:18.210	just left out so many things. He left out making
195	00:14:18.220	00:14:22.460	permanent the tax cuts that cost $1.7 trillion over the
196	00:14:22.470	00:14:25.080	next ten years. You put all those things back together,
197	00:14:25.090	00:14:27.470	and what you have is a pattern that takes us
198	00:14:27.480	00:14:31.020	deeper and deeper into deficit and debt. Senator Gregg, what's
199	00:14:31.030	00:14:33.380	your response to that--because that's the criticism from the
200	00:14:33.390	00:14:36.920	Democrats here, that there's so many big-ticket items that aren't
201	00:14:36.930	00:14:41.620	included, how credible should the American people look upon these
202	00:14:41.630	00:14:45.820	projections of cutting the deficit in half by 2009? Well,
203	00:14:45.830	00:14:48.310	first off, they can look very much at what the
204	00:14:48.320	00:14:51.500	president has proposed in specific spending restraint. And we'll look
205	00:14:51.510	00:14:55.250	forward to our Democratic colleagues joining us in restraining those
206	00:14:55.260	00:14:59.510	spending programs if they're interested in reducing the deficit. As
207	00:14:59.520	00:15:02.970	to the specific issue of, for example, war costs, five
208	00:15:02.980	00:15:05.540	years from now hopefully we won't be at war. In
209	00:15:05.550	00:15:07.370	fact, I'm sure we won't be at war in Iran
210	00:15:07.380	00:15:12.900	or Iraq--or in Iraq or Afghanistan. And as a
211	00:15:12.910	00:15:16.690	result, we shouldn't be building that number into the base,
212	00:15:16.700	00:15:22.120	the war costs into the base. The revenues which the
213	00:15:22.130	00:15:24.790	senator from North Dakota appears to want to increase by
214	00:15:24.800	00:15:27.730	raising taxes, that's not the approach that we want to
215	00:15:27.740	00:15:30.030	take. But if they believe they should raise taxes to
216	00:15:30.040	00:15:32.730	reduce this deficit, then let them bring forward a budget
217	00:15:32.740	00:15:35.000	that raises taxes, or let them bring forward a budget
218	00:15:35.010	00:15:38.310	that promotes their cuts. But where--if there are all
219	00:15:38.320	00:15:41.260	these other costs that are known--that are known to
220	00:15:41.270	00:15:44.090	be in fact incurred--Well, I don't accept...You don't
221	00:15:44.100	00:15:47.590	accept the $81 billion that the administration is about to
222	00:15:47.600	00:15:50.510	command the Iraq War? I don't have any problem with
223	00:15:50.520	00:15:52.310	stating that number, but I don't think you build it
224	00:15:52.320	00:15:54.470	into the base, because five years from now, it's not
225	00:15:54.480	00:15:57.540	going to be there. That number goes away. This is
226	00:15:57.550	00:15:59.530	not a one-time item. It is going to be a
227	00:15:59.540	00:16:02.380	two- or three-year item. Two or three years from now,
228	00:16:02.390	00:16:04.820	I don't want to increase defense spending by the cost
229	00:16:04.830	00:16:07.060	of that war, so that the defense base suddenly has
230	00:16:07.070	00:16:09.300	$80 billion of extra funds in it after the war
231	00:16:09.310	00:16:11.230	is over. And I think that would be a bad
232	00:16:11.240	00:16:14.460	policy. You talked about reducing the deficit in half in
233	00:16:14.470	00:16:16.880	four years. I think the president has put on the
234	00:16:16.890	00:16:20.150	table legitimate numbers that move us in that direction rather
235	00:16:20.160	00:16:22.580	aggressively. And I have heard from the other side nothing
236	00:16:22.590	00:16:27.760	from their proposals to accomplish deficit reduction other than raising
237	00:16:27.770	00:16:31.020	taxes. In my opinion, that wouldn't help the economy. It
238	00:16:31.030	00:16:33.860	probably would slow revenue growth in many ways, as a
239	00:16:33.870	00:16:36.370	result of the economy slowing down. Senator Conrad, what would
240	00:16:36.380	00:16:39.730	be the Democrats' alternative? Well, first of all, I want
241	00:16:39.740	00:16:44.290	to correct a couple of misimpressions. I've not advocated raising
242	00:16:44.300	00:16:47.270	taxes. I have said revenue has to be part of
243	00:16:47.280	00:16:50.270	the solution, and the first place we ought to look
244	00:16:50.280	00:16:53.700	for revenue is the tax gap. That is the difference
245	00:16:53.710	00:16:56.600	between what is owed and what is being paid. The
246	00:16:56.610	00:17:01.130	Bush administration itself says that that gap was $300 billion
247	00:17:01.140	00:17:05.230	in 2001. That's people who are getting away without paying
248	00:17:05.240	00:17:07.990	what they owe, shoving the rest of the burden onto
249	00:17:08.000	00:17:09.870	all the rest of us who do pay what we
250	00:17:09.880	00:17:12.930	owe. That would be the first place I'd look. Second,
251	00:17:12.940	00:17:16.560	they talk about spending restraint. Is there really spending restraint
252	00:17:16.570	00:17:20.530	in this budget? The president's budget increases spending by 8
253	00:17:20.540	00:17:23.820	percent over last year. Now, they've put a lot of
254	00:17:23.830	00:17:26.950	focus on the cuts. I understand that. But if you
255	00:17:26.960	00:17:30.900	look at the overall budget, it increases spending 8 percent.
256	00:17:30.910	00:17:33.920	At the same time, the president says cut the revenue
257	00:17:33.930	00:17:39.300	$1.7 trillion, we already have record deficits. You know, when
258	00:17:39.310	00:17:42.290	you increase spending and you cut revenue, and you can't
259	00:17:42.300	00:17:46.000	pay your bills to begin with, there's only one possible
260	00:17:46.010	00:17:50.470	outcome. That's more deficit, more debt, more borrowing, and a
261	00:17:50.480	00:17:53.170	weaker America. That's the prescription in this president's plan. Let
262	00:17:53.180	00:17:55.220	me just ask Senator Conrad--I would just like to
263	00:17:55.230	00:17:58.640	just quickly respond on this-Okay.--on two points. First,
264	00:17:58.650	00:18:01.830	the spending restraint is there, and we will see whether
265	00:18:01.840	00:18:03.560	or not our colleagues on the other side of the
266	00:18:03.570	00:18:06.530	aisle are willing to address it. The increases in spending
267	00:18:06.540	00:18:10.970	which the senator mentions--which are legitimate numbers--go to
268	00:18:10.980	00:18:14.740	fighting the war and Medicare primarily. Now, maybe they're willing
269	00:18:14.750	00:18:17.900	to cut the efforts in defense and maybe they're willing
270	00:18:17.910	00:18:20.090	to cut the efforts in Medicare, but I doubt it.
271	00:18:20.100	00:18:24.060	Non-discretionary defense spending is kept below the rate of inflation.
272	00:18:24.070	00:18:26.590	And there are proposals to reduce spending on the agriculture
273	00:18:26.600	00:18:28.780	programs, which I doubt that the other side is going
274	00:18:28.790	00:18:31.370	to be too excited about, and in other entitlements such
275	00:18:31.380	00:18:34.240	as Medicaid. On the revenue side, let's remember, revenues are
276	00:18:34.250	00:18:37.260	going up rather dramatically. Last year they increased by 9.2
277	00:18:37.270	00:18:40.700	percent. This year they're projected to increase by 6.5 percent.
278	00:18:40.710	00:18:44.880	We're headed on a path to receive much more in
279	00:18:44.890	00:18:47.480	the way of revenues as a result of the fact
280	00:18:47.490	00:18:50.940	that we shallowed out this recession by putting a tax
281	00:18:50.950	00:18:53.030	cut in place early on in the recession so that
282	00:18:53.040	00:18:56.080	we didn't have a significant economic--as significant an economic
283	00:18:56.090	00:18:58.760	downturn as we might have had. So we're getting significant
284	00:18:58.770	00:19:01.270	revenue growth, and putting a tax cut on top of
285	00:19:01.280	00:19:04.740	this economy would be very counterproductive. All right, Senator Conrad,
286	00:19:04.750	00:19:07.720	let me--let's talk now about the actual cuts. And
287	00:19:07.730	00:19:09.860	I take your point that the overall budget is growing,
288	00:19:09.870	00:19:13.740	but there is an actual cut in this non-homeland security,
289	00:19:13.750	00:19:17.900	non-defense part of the budget. Do you have a quarrel
290	00:19:17.910	00:19:22.560	with those specific cuts, and if you don't, where else
291	00:19:22.570	00:19:24.370	would you cut? I mean, if you do, where else
292	00:19:24.380	00:19:26.670	would you cut? Yeah, there are priorities here that I
293	00:19:26.680	00:19:30.640	think are badly misplaced. For example, I would not cut
294	00:19:30.650	00:19:35.090	the cops program by 96 percent. Cops program has put
295	00:19:35.100	00:19:38.070	100,000 police officers on the street in this country. That's
296	00:19:38.080	00:19:41.530	reduced crime. When we've got a terrorist threat, why ever
297	00:19:41.540	00:19:44.330	would you reduce the number of police on the street?
298	00:19:44.340	00:19:48.270	I wouldn't cut the firefighters by 30 percent. I wouldn't
299	00:19:48.280	00:19:52.790	eliminate funding for vocational education. You know, not everybody goes
300	00:19:52.800	00:19:56.860	to college. And to eliminate the education for those who
301	00:19:56.870	00:19:58.780	are going to go into the trades I just think
302	00:19:58.790	00:20:01.520	is shortsighted for this country. So there are cuts that
303	00:20:01.530	00:20:04.230	don't make sense. There are other cuts, frankly, that I
304	00:20:04.240	00:20:06.410	do support. I think we do need to go after
305	00:20:06.420	00:20:09.710	states that are abusing and taking advantage of the Medicaid
306	00:20:09.720	00:20:16.420	system. I would support limitations, payment limitations in agriculture, even
307	00:20:16.430	00:20:19.260	though I come from a farm state. So there are
308	00:20:19.270	00:20:21.760	places I would support the cuts. There are others that
309	00:20:21.770	00:20:25.560	I think are very misplaced. But overall, remember, this is
310	00:20:25.570	00:20:30.630	not a budget that cuts spending. It increases spending 8%,
311	00:20:30.640	00:20:33.400	even though we already have record deficits. And then the
312	00:20:33.410	00:20:36.040	president turns around and says, oh, by the way, cut
313	00:20:36.050	00:20:39.630	the revenue base by nearly $2 trillion on top of
314	00:20:39.640	00:20:42.970	it. There can only be one result. That's more deficits
315	00:20:42.980	00:20:46.220	and more debt. Going to the cuts, Senator Gregg, a
316	00:20:46.230	00:20:48.810	lot of these cuts--I mean, there are others--the
317	00:20:48.820	00:20:52.090	ones Senator Conrad named, and also things like increasing the
318	00:20:52.100	00:20:54.610	cost to some veterans for the health care benefits they
319	00:20:54.620	00:21:00.610	receive, eliminating Amtrak. All of these programs have powerful constituencies
320	00:21:00.620	00:21:04.610	on Capitol Hill, including with your own fellow Republicans. How
321	00:21:04.620	00:21:08.150	realistic is it that these cuts will get through? Well,
322	00:21:08.160	00:21:10.540	first off, I want to congratulate Senator Conrad if he's
323	00:21:10.550	00:21:14.600	willing to address agriculture from North Dakota. I congratulate him--
324	00:21:14.610	00:21:17.520	equally so in the Medicaid areas. I certainly hope we
325	00:21:17.530	00:21:21.550	can reach agreement on those two areas. Well, my view
326	00:21:21.560	00:21:24.080	is that last year we showed that we can discipline
327	00:21:24.090	00:21:26.830	the budget on a discretionary side and on defense when
328	00:21:26.840	00:21:31.590	we set a number of $822 billion. The Congress wanted
329	00:21:31.600	00:21:33.510	to spend considerably more than that. The White House said
330	00:21:33.520	00:21:36.200	no, and we ended up with $822 billion. If we
331	00:21:36.210	00:21:38.370	can reach agreement on a top line number--this year
332	00:21:38.380	00:21:42.160	the White House is suggesting $840 billion--and then let
333	00:21:42.170	00:21:44.560	the Congress set its priorities within that number, there may
334	00:21:44.570	00:21:47.490	be programs we'll support that the president doesn't support, and
335	00:21:47.500	00:21:50.670	there may be programs he supports that we will support.
336	00:21:50.680	00:21:53.960	Let us work out the details, but at least agree
337	00:21:53.970	00:21:56.380	on a top line number that is enforceable by something
338	00:21:56.390	00:21:58.820	called spending caps. And that's the way you make this
339	00:21:58.830	00:22:01.550	work. Is that doable, Senator Conrad? Do you think you
340	00:22:01.560	00:22:03.720	can agree on an overall number at least, and then
341	00:22:03.730	00:22:07.110	let the appropriators decide where the cuts come? I would
342	00:22:07.120	00:22:09.230	hope we could. And one thing where Senator Gregg and
343	00:22:09.240	00:22:13.250	I think are joined is on the spending disciplines; that
344	00:22:13.260	00:22:16.410	is, restoring the old pay-go rules that say if you're
345	00:22:16.420	00:22:19.430	going to increase spending or you're going to cut taxes,
346	00:22:19.440	00:22:22.170	you've got to pay for it. And that's a discipline
347	00:22:22.180	00:22:25.620	we badly need reenacted around here, and I'm hoping on
348	00:22:25.630	00:22:28.920	a bipartisan basis we can do that. Senator Conrad, let
349	00:22:28.930	00:22:31.310	me ask you this. If you look at--whether it's
350	00:22:31.320	00:22:34.340	the five-year part of this budget or the ten-year, we
351	00:22:34.350	00:22:36.660	are now seeing deficits, as the old saying goes, "as
352	00:22:36.670	00:22:39.370	far as the eye can see." Do you think we
353	00:22:39.380	00:22:41.900	will ever get back to the point of balancing the
354	00:22:41.910	00:22:45.350	federal books? It's critical that we do. The thing that
355	00:22:45.360	00:22:47.640	I most fault the president on is that he has
356	00:22:47.650	00:22:49.870	left the American people with the impression that he is
357	00:22:49.880	00:22:54.730	reducing our fiscal imbalances. The fact is, he is not.
358	00:22:54.740	00:22:58.280	He is dramatically increasing our deficit and debt in the
359	00:22:58.290	00:23:01.330	long term. If you look just beyond this five-year budget
360	00:23:01.340	00:23:05.210	window, all the things he's left out explode in cost.
361	00:23:05.220	00:23:08.570	And that's going to put this country in very, very
362	00:23:08.580	00:23:11.680	grave difficulty, given the fact it's right when the baby
363	00:23:11.690	00:23:15.680	boomers begin to retire. It will force very, very deep
364	00:23:15.690	00:23:19.510	and draconian cuts. That's a very important point. Senator Gregg,
365	00:23:19.520	00:23:21.800	are we looking at eternal deficits? Is that really the
366	00:23:21.810	00:23:24.830	message of this budget? No, not at all. What you're
367	00:23:24.840	00:23:27.310	looking at is two different problems here. In the short
368	00:23:27.320	00:23:30.260	term, we can certainly manage the deficit. We can reduce
369	00:23:30.270	00:23:33.580	it by half, which will be an historic low, relative
370	00:23:33.590	00:23:37.260	to the period that, we're over the last 20 years
371	00:23:37.270	00:23:41.050	except for that period when we had surpluses. But the
372	00:23:41.060	00:23:44.410	problem is the demographic situation that occurs in this country,
373	00:23:44.420	00:23:46.960	which is, when the baby boom generation starts to retire
374	00:23:46.970	00:23:52.370	in 2008, the demands of my population, of our generation
375	00:23:52.380	00:23:56.180	here on younger Americans, our children and our grandchildren--for
376	00:23:56.190	00:23:59.050	our retirement benefits, for our health care costs--are going
377	00:23:59.060	00:24:01.490	to be absolutely astronomical. And there simply aren't going to
378	00:24:01.500	00:24:04.700	be enough people working to support the retired generation, because
379	00:24:04.710	00:24:07.470	the retired generation will be so large. That is a
380	00:24:07.480	00:24:09.630	huge issue. The president has been willing to step up
381	00:24:09.640	00:24:11.790	to that issue by taking on the question of how
382	00:24:11.800	00:24:13.700	we reform Social Security. So I think you've got to
383	00:24:13.710	00:24:17.750	give him credit for recognizing that the long-term structural issue,
384	00:24:17.760	00:24:20.720	which is demographically driven--we're all alive, we all exist,
385	00:24:20.730	00:24:23.050	and most of us are going to retire and take
386	00:24:23.060	00:24:25.940	advantage of the retire system--is there, and you've got
387	00:24:25.950	00:24:28.250	to address it. So his stepping out on the issue
388	00:24:28.260	00:24:30.710	of Social Security is a very positive step in the right
389	00:24:30.720	00:24:33.280	direction towards opening the debate on how we address the
390	00:24:33.290	00:24:36.310	long-term deficit. But Senator Gregg, that does raise the question
391	00:24:36.320	00:24:39.000	that none of the Social Security transition costs are even
392	00:24:39.010	00:24:42.560	in this budget projection, even if we phase it in,
393	00:24:42.570	00:24:44.530	as I think he's suggesting--I think it's something like
394	00:24:44.540	00:24:50.310	$750 billion or $780 billion by 2009--where does that
395	00:24:50.320	00:24:53.940	come from? Where does this budget leave the prospects for
396	00:24:53.950	00:24:58.870	the Social Security overhaul being passed this year? Well, Social
397	00:24:58.880	00:25:00.990	Security has about five major moving parts, and if you
398	00:25:01.000	00:25:03.150	address it in a comprehensive way, you'll put it into
399	00:25:03.160	00:25:05.590	balance. And if you put it into balance, you'll save
400	00:25:05.600	00:25:08.310	massive amounts of dollars in the out years--something like
401	00:25:08.320	00:25:11.240	$11 trillion. And part of that is the personal account
402	00:25:11.250	00:25:14.540	approach. Part of it would be changing the bend points,
403	00:25:14.550	00:25:16.650	which is basically means testing. Part of it would be
404	00:25:16.660	00:25:19.330	getting a proper COLA. But you've to do a balanced,
405	00:25:19.340	00:25:21.850	comprehensive approach. But once you do that, yes, you'll have
406	00:25:21.860	00:25:26.110	some short-term increases in costs, because you've got to get
407	00:25:26.120	00:25:28.180	to the corrections in the system that give you the
408	00:25:28.190	00:25:32.880	long-term benefit. But over the long-term, you'll have huge savings
409	00:25:32.890	00:25:35.450	and you'll make the system solvent, which is the key
410	00:25:35.460	00:25:38.090	here for our children and our grandchildren, who are going
411	00:25:38.100	00:25:40.160	to have to pay to support us, and we don't
412	00:25:40.170	00:25:41.510	want to put too much of a tax burden on
413	00:25:41.520	00:25:44.280	them to do that. Senator Conrad, I guess what I'm really asking
414	00:25:44.290	00:25:47.230	is, do you think the Social Security reform is politically
415	00:25:47.240	00:25:49.300	doable this year as the president would like to do,
416	00:25:49.310	00:25:51.880	when at the same time the members of Congress and
417	00:25:51.890	00:25:55.620	the Senate are looking at these deficits? You know, the
418	00:25:55.630	00:25:58.440	president has made it all more difficult, first of all,
419	00:25:58.450	00:26:02.520	by not acknowledging the privatization cost. The 20-year costs are
420	00:26:02.530	00:26:07.810	$4.6 trillion, and he proposes borrowing all of it. That's
421	00:26:07.820	00:26:11.070	not a solution to a problem. Second of all, in
422	00:26:11.080	00:26:14.600	the short-term, the president over the next ten years is
423	00:26:14.610	00:26:18.780	taking over $2.5 trillion of Social Security money and using
424	00:26:18.790	00:26:21.440	it to pay for other things. That just digs the
425	00:26:21.450	00:26:24.300	hole deeper before starting to fill it in. Now, this
426	00:26:24.310	00:26:27.550	is a policy--this is a policy not of reducing
427	00:26:27.560	00:26:31.460	deficits and facing up to problems. This is a budget
428	00:26:31.470	00:26:35.490	plan that hides problems from the American people and hides
429	00:26:35.500	00:26:38.870	the result. The inevitable result will have put us in
430	00:26:38.880	00:26:42.420	a very deep hole and weaken the country's economic strength.
431	00:26:42.430	00:26:45.240	That's a mistake. Senator Conrad and Chairman Gregg, thank you
432	00:26:45.250	00:26:49.350	both. Thank you. Still to come on the NewsHour tonight,
433	00:26:49.360	00:26:53.070	more progress toward peace in the Middle East, preventing medical
434	00:26:53.080	00:27:06.410	errors and why they call it the Super Bowl. Our
435	00:27:06.420	00:27:11.500	Middle East update. Ray Suarez is in charge. Israel's prime
436	00:27:11.510	00:27:15.500	minister, Ariel Sharon, and Mahmoud Abbas, the newly-elected president of
437	00:27:15.510	00:27:18.800	the Palestinian Authority, will declare an end to more than
438	00:27:18.810	00:27:21.730	four years of fighting when they meet tomorrow in Sharm
439	00:27:21.740	00:27:25.140	El Sheikh, Egypt. Officials from both sides said the truce
440	00:27:25.150	00:27:28.820	deal had been worked out in pre-summit talks. That announcement
441	00:27:28.830	00:27:31.960	came as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wrapped up her
442	00:27:31.970	00:27:35.160	first official visit to the area. Calling this a "moment
443	00:27:35.170	00:27:38.700	of opportunity," Rice named a U.S. Army general to act
444	00:27:38.710	00:27:43.330	as security coordinator between Palestinians and Israelis. For more on
445	00:27:43.340	00:27:48.190	these developments, we turn to Newsweek's Jerusalem correspondent, Dan Ephron.
446	00:27:48.200	00:27:53.150	Dan, welcome. Does Rice's visit, the new secretary of state,
447	00:27:53.160	00:27:56.610	constitute an active return of the United States to Middle
448	00:27:56.620	00:28:01.030	East diplomacy? Well, I think the Palestinians certainly hope that
449	00:28:01.040	00:28:04.290	it does. And I think it probably does. It's a
450	00:28:04.300	00:28:06.870	bigger sign than anything we've seen, I would say, in
451	00:28:06.880	00:28:10.470	the past 18 months that the Americans are now willing
452	00:28:10.480	00:28:13.290	to engage. If you recall, it was in September of
453	00:28:13.300	00:28:17.620	2003 when this very same Mahmoud Abbas stepped down as
454	00:28:17.630	00:28:21.840	the Palestinian prime minister, and from that stage on, the
455	00:28:21.850	00:28:24.920	Americans really washed their hands of this thing. There have
456	00:28:24.930	00:28:28.020	been no regular envoys. And this is, I think, the
457	00:28:28.030	00:28:30.750	first visit by a secretary of state from the United
458	00:28:30.760	00:28:35.830	States since then. What is Lt. General William Ward, the
459	00:28:35.840	00:28:40.530	new security coordinator, going to do? Well, I think that's
460	00:28:40.540	00:28:43.960	one of the interesting things that has emerged from Secretary
461	00:28:43.970	00:28:46.790	Rice's visit here. In the past, I think for the
462	00:28:46.800	00:28:50.130	most part the United States has sent troubleshooters who deal
463	00:28:50.140	00:28:53.330	with diplomacy, who deal with politics, who go back and
464	00:28:53.340	00:28:56.770	forth between Jerusalem and Ramallah carrying messages and trying to
465	00:28:56.780	00:29:01.060	bridge political issues. In this case, the U.S. has appointed
466	00:29:01.070	00:29:05.040	a security coordinator who will probably remain primarily on the
467	00:29:05.050	00:29:09.840	Palestinian side and help the Palestinians reconstitute their police force.
468	00:29:09.850	00:29:12.870	I think what this says is that the United States
469	00:29:12.880	00:29:16.340	is lining itself more or less up with what Israel
470	00:29:16.350	00:29:19.300	has asked for, which is that this process, at least
471	00:29:19.310	00:29:23.350	in the coming months, be much more security oriented than
472	00:29:23.360	00:29:26.290	political; that is to say, that the first step is
473	00:29:26.300	00:29:29.170	that Palestinians have to get their police force back in
474	00:29:29.180	00:29:32.490	order, and not only come to a ceasefire with these
475	00:29:32.500	00:29:35.430	groups, as apparently they have, but actually move ahead and
476	00:29:35.440	00:29:40.110	start dismantling some of these militant groups. Will Lt. General
477	00:29:40.120	00:29:43.460	Ward be welcomed more by one side than the other?
478	00:29:43.470	00:29:48.340	Was this appointment something that Israelis or Palestinians wanted more
479	00:29:48.350	00:29:51.540	than the other? It's hard to say. I don't think
480	00:29:51.550	00:29:55.660	that the Palestinians will necessarily turn him away or be
481	00:29:55.670	00:29:59.790	unwelcoming. I think it does say that what the Israelis
482	00:29:59.800	00:30:03.300	wanted, the Israelis got. The Israelis have talked all along
483	00:30:03.310	00:30:07.010	throughout this process since Yasser Arafat died that if there
484	00:30:07.020	00:30:10.850	is going to be a resumption of some negotiation or
485	00:30:10.860	00:30:14.740	a return to the road map, to that U.S.-backed peace
486	00:30:14.750	00:30:18.890	plan, that it has to start with security measures. For
487	00:30:18.900	00:30:23.770	the Israelis, that means getting Palestinians to deploy both in
488	00:30:23.780	00:30:26.290	the West Bank and Gaza, to get their police force
489	00:30:26.300	00:30:29.780	back in order, and getting them to fight these groups
490	00:30:29.790	00:30:32.130	that have carried out much of the violence over the
491	00:30:32.140	00:30:36.350	last four years. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, has talked
492	00:30:36.360	00:30:39.980	about a ceasefire. He's talked about co-opting these militants. I
493	00:30:39.990	00:30:42.820	think what the Israelis want and what they're hoping this
494	00:30:42.830	00:30:46.620	security coordinator from the United States will help achieve is
495	00:30:46.630	00:30:50.530	actually something further, actually dismantling these groups. Mahmoud Abbas is
496	00:30:50.540	00:30:53.450	still pretty early in his tenure as president of the
497	00:30:53.460	00:30:57.910	PA. Has he really gotten his arms around the security
498	00:30:57.920	00:31:00.800	structure yet? Does he have the clout, the authority to
499	00:31:00.810	00:31:03.970	hold up his end of the ceasefire? Well, I think
500	00:31:03.980	00:31:06.270	those are two separate questions. I don't think he's gotten
501	00:31:06.280	00:31:09.860	himself around the security structure. I think there are changes
502	00:31:09.870	00:31:14.340	he talked about making during his campaign about consolidating, about
503	00:31:14.350	00:31:18.380	renewing. But I think the matter of a mandate is
504	00:31:18.390	00:31:23.210	something else. Mahmoud Abbas ran on a pledge to stop
505	00:31:23.220	00:31:27.120	the intifada, and he was elected by a large majority.
506	00:31:27.130	00:31:30.210	And I think in that respect, many Palestinians, including groups
507	00:31:30.220	00:31:33.910	that are opposed to a ceasefire with Israel--even Hamas,
508	00:31:33.920	00:31:38.370	this Islamic group--I think has some sense that this
509	00:31:38.380	00:31:41.220	is the will of the people, that most Palestinians are
510	00:31:41.230	00:31:46.940	tired of this violence, and that their voice has spoken
511	00:31:46.950	00:31:51.220	in electing Mahmoud Abbas. And I think there's a tendency
512	00:31:51.230	00:31:53.840	anyway to let that go forward for the time being.
513	00:31:53.850	00:31:56.530	That soon to be announced ceasefire has gotten a lot
514	00:31:56.540	00:31:59.080	of the attention, but what else is on the agenda
515	00:31:59.090	00:32:01.230	for Sharm El Sheikh? What else do the two sides
516	00:32:01.240	00:32:04.630	have to talk about? Well, one of the interesting things...
517	00:32:04.640	00:32:07.720	first of all, this has been carefully choreographed. I think
518	00:32:07.730	00:32:10.780	that's in part true because there have been other summits--
519	00:32:10.790	00:32:14.710	certainly many summits between Israelis and Palestinians over the years,
520	00:32:14.720	00:32:17.220	and even other summits during these four and a half
521	00:32:17.230	00:32:19.310	years of violence. I think the two sides wanted to
522	00:32:19.320	00:32:21.830	make sure that when they got there, they had all
523	00:32:21.840	00:32:25.840	their t's crossed and their i's dotted. And I think in
524	00:32:25.850	00:32:29.460	some respects they do. The language of this declaration of
525	00:32:29.470	00:32:32.920	ceasefire has been laid out carefully. But I think another
526	00:32:32.930	00:32:36.640	significant aspect of the summit is the fact that President
527	00:32:36.650	00:32:40.950	Mubarak and King Abdullah of Egypt and Jordan are there,
528	00:32:40.960	00:32:44.670	and they're there with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, the Israeli
529	00:32:44.680	00:32:49.020	leader, who was really a pariah in the Arab world
530	00:32:49.030	00:32:51.950	for much of the past 20 years. I think in
531	00:32:51.960	00:32:55.570	some respects this is the first time the Arab world,
532	00:32:55.580	00:32:58.370	or part of the Arab world, is giving Ariel Sharon
533	00:32:58.380	00:33:04.010	legitimacy. Why isn't Secretary Rice going to the conference? She's
534	00:33:04.020	00:33:08.100	been in the neighborhood. She's been holding news conferences, been
535	00:33:08.110	00:33:11.590	photographed with heads of government. This would seem to be
536	00:33:11.600	00:33:15.510	the logical next step, no? I think you're right on
537	00:33:15.520	00:33:19.010	the face of things, but I think the United States
538	00:33:19.020	00:33:23.100	has watched this thing happen over the last months, these
539	00:33:23.110	00:33:29.090	contacts between Israelis and Palestinians--really the first substantive contacts
540	00:33:29.100	00:33:34.760	in a very long time--without necessarily being involved. And
541	00:33:34.770	00:33:37.170	I think for the United States, there's some advantage to
542	00:33:37.180	00:33:41.510	letting Israelis and Palestinians work this thing through, inasmuch as
543	00:33:41.520	00:33:45.240	the two sides are sitting down and talking about the
544	00:33:45.250	00:33:48.820	right things. So inasmuch as that has happened over the
545	00:33:48.830	00:33:52.160	last month, I think Secretary Rice and generally the Bush
546	00:33:52.170	00:33:56.190	administration has been happy to let this thing go just
547	00:33:56.200	00:33:59.100	between Israelis and Arabs. I think another issue is that
548	00:33:59.110	00:34:04.250	this is really President Mubarak's show, Egyptian President's Mubarak's show.
549	00:34:04.260	00:34:06.430	And I think there was a sense that if Secretary
550	00:34:06.440	00:34:10.790	Rice was there, or someone else from the administration, that
551	00:34:10.800	00:34:15.160	they would steal the limelight from President Mubarak. Dan Ephron,
552	00:34:15.170	00:34:30.670	from Newsweek Magazine, thanks for being with us. Thank you.
553	00:34:30.680	00:34:35.730	Now, preventing medical errors before they lead to deadly consequences.
554	00:34:35.740	00:34:38.320	Susan Dentzer of our health unit has a look at
555	00:34:38.330	00:34:41.540	how one health care system is dealing with that problem.
556	00:34:41.550	00:34:44.490	The unit's a partnership with the Henry J. Kaiser Family
557	00:34:44.500	00:34:48.530	Foundation. Good morning, Mr. Hilliard. How are you doing? When
558	00:34:48.540	00:34:52.190	Dr. Ross Fletcher visits patients here at the Washington, DC
559	00:34:52.200	00:34:56.050	Veterans' Administration Hospital, he knows he should first cleanse his
560	00:34:56.060	00:35:00.690	hands. A quick rub with an alcohol foam disinfectant can
561	00:35:00.700	00:35:04.550	help prevent the spread of costly bacterial infections. Those kill
562	00:35:04.560	00:35:08.770	tens of thousands of hospital patients every year. Take a
563	00:35:08.780	00:35:11.890	deep breath. Most health care providers know they should follow
564	00:35:11.900	00:35:16.190	the hand-cleansing procedure, but they don't always do it. Fletcher
565	00:35:16.200	00:35:19.390	says the VA decided to change that. When we first
566	00:35:19.400	00:35:22.620	started this program, we noticed that about 40 percent of
567	00:35:22.630	00:35:28.570	the time hand cleansing occurred satisfactorily. More recently it's been
568	00:35:28.580	00:35:30.550	more well into the 80 percent range and we hope
569	00:35:30.560	00:35:33.260	to get it close to 100 percent, so that any
570	00:35:33.270	00:35:37.630	patient requiring hand cleansing will have that happen. What we've
571	00:35:37.640	00:35:41.670	noticed in addition is that using the alcohol foam cleansing
572	00:35:41.680	00:35:46.170	agent, we've been able to further reduce, over just simple
573	00:35:46.180	00:35:54.330	hand washing, the incidence of very serious antibiotic resistant infections.
574	00:35:54.340	00:35:56.900	The VA managed to double the rate of hand cleansing
575	00:35:56.910	00:36:00.520	in the simplest of ways, for example by putting disinfectant
576	00:36:00.530	00:36:04.040	dispensers right here on the walls of patients' rooms. It's
577	00:36:04.050	00:36:07.390	a simple change that saves both money and lives, and
578	00:36:07.400	00:36:09.670	it's just the sort of measure called for five years
579	00:36:09.680	00:36:13.650	ago in this blockbuster report by the Institute of Medicine.
580	00:36:13.660	00:36:18.190	Titled "to err is human," the 1999 report estimated that
581	00:36:18.200	00:36:23.920	avoidable errors in U.S. hospitals were killing 44,000 to 98,000
582	00:36:23.930	00:36:28.610	Americans a year and injuring thousands more. The report said
583	00:36:28.620	00:36:32.010	that was the equivalent of a jumbo jet crashing every
584	00:36:32.020	00:36:35.490	day. One of the report's authors was Dr. Lucian Leape
585	00:36:35.500	00:36:37.940	of the Harvard School of Public Health. The Institute of
586	00:36:37.950	00:36:41.740	Medicine report in 1999 called for a national commitment, a
587	00:36:41.750	00:36:45.100	moon shot, I mean, a serious national effort to reduce
588	00:36:45.110	00:36:47.920	medical errors. We said we could reduce medical errors by
589	00:36:47.930	00:36:50.530	50 percent in five years if we had that kind
590	00:36:50.540	00:36:54.570	of national commitment. But Leape and other safety experts say
591	00:36:54.580	00:36:58.770	that national commitment failed to materialize. There's been a bill
592	00:36:58.780	00:37:01.270	before Congress every year for the last four years to
593	00:37:01.280	00:37:03.470	provide protection, and we just don't seem to be able
594	00:37:03.480	00:37:06.450	to get it passed. Dr. Robert Wachter of the University
595	00:37:06.460	00:37:09.980	of California at San Francisco coauthored a book on patient
596	00:37:09.990	00:37:14.470	safety. Everybody--every doctor, everybody, every nurse, every hospital administrator--
597	00:37:14.480	00:37:17.130	knows we have a terrible problem and they really are
598	00:37:17.140	00:37:19.820	desperate. I mean, just think about if a jumbo jet
599	00:37:19.830	00:37:22.710	was crashing every day what we would be doing to
600	00:37:22.720	00:37:26.230	solve that problem. If there's good news, say these safety
601	00:37:26.240	00:37:30.120	experts, it's that despite the lack of national commitment, some
602	00:37:30.130	00:37:33.520	health systems like the VA are taking steps to solve
603	00:37:33.530	00:37:37.940	problems. Dr. Jonathan Perlin, who heads the VA health system,
604	00:37:37.950	00:37:41.210	acknowledges that was not always the case. It's fair to
605	00:37:41.220	00:37:45.570	say that historically, the VA's reputation was not...was not
606	00:37:45.580	00:37:48.140	perfect and we realized we needed to change and what
607	00:37:48.150	00:37:50.890	we saw was that we needed to improve safety, improve
608	00:37:50.900	00:37:55.280	quality and improve the compassion with which we delivered care.
609	00:37:55.290	00:37:58.860	So to lead its own moon shot against medical errors,
610	00:37:58.870	00:38:02.910	the VA picked this man, physician and former astronaut James
611	00:38:02.920	00:38:07.220	Bagian. Among other things, Bagian had helped to investigate space
612	00:38:07.230	00:38:11.760	shuttle disasters at NASA. He thought aviation and aerospace had
613	00:38:11.770	00:38:14.510	plenty to teach health care. An airmail pilot back in
614	00:38:14.520	00:38:16.950	the thirties had a life expectancy on the job of
615	00:38:16.960	00:38:20.290	three to four years. And it wasn't until the '50s
616	00:38:20.300	00:38:22.810	that aviation really started looking and saying, we can't just
617	00:38:22.820	00:38:27.900	keep building more planes when we crash them. So aviation
618	00:38:27.910	00:38:32.430	developed a so-called systems approach to improving safety. That includes
619	00:38:32.440	00:38:36.900	an emphasis on teamwork and fixed procedures; those prevent airline
620	00:38:36.910	00:38:40.350	crews from making mistakes, or to provide a backstop to
621	00:38:40.360	00:38:43.400	thwart crashes in the event that errors occur. It was
622	00:38:43.410	00:38:46.450	understanding, "we standardize." It's not like everybody has their own
623	00:38:46.460	00:38:48.220	little way they want to fly the plane. We said,
624	00:38:48.230	00:38:49.970	there are certain ways to do it; that we use
625	00:38:49.980	00:38:52.780	checklists for certain things; that, you know, you take away
626	00:38:52.790	00:38:57.220	certain latitudes. Bagian says applying systems thinking to VA health
627	00:38:57.230	00:39:01.440	care started with a similar cultural change. Rather than burying
628	00:39:01.450	00:39:05.070	mistakes or punishing people involved in them, the VA had
629	00:39:05.080	00:39:10.150	to ferret them out. Borrowing another leaf from airline safety,
630	00:39:10.160	00:39:14.200	VA personnel are now required to report any adverse events
631	00:39:14.210	00:39:18.510	through an internal computerized reporting system. They're also required to
632	00:39:18.520	00:39:24.610	report so-called "near-misses" or "close calls"--instances when something dangerous
633	00:39:24.620	00:39:28.470	almost happens to patients but doesn't. Close calls happen anywhere
634	00:39:28.480	00:39:32.180	from ten to 200 times more frequently than the event
635	00:39:32.190	00:39:34.490	they're the precursor of. So you can think of for
636	00:39:34.500	00:39:37.110	every incorrect surgery that's done, there's anywhere from ten to
637	00:39:37.120	00:39:40.490	200 that almost happened. Why not learn from those? Bagian
638	00:39:40.500	00:39:46.720	simulated for us how the reporting system works. Patient almost
639	00:39:46.730	00:39:56.130	had surgery performed on the incorrect leg. VA safety experts
640	00:39:56.140	00:39:59.640	analyze these reports and then launch a so-called root cause
641	00:39:59.650	00:40:03.170	analysis. That's when a small team is assembled to probe
642	00:40:03.180	00:40:05.930	the chain of factors leading up to a given adverse
643	00:40:05.940	00:40:10.730	event. Take the problem Bagian simulated: Operating on the wrong
644	00:40:10.740	00:40:14.910	site of the patient's body. It's surprisingly common throughout U.S.
645	00:40:14.920	00:40:18.700	hospitals, especially when surgery involves a part that the body
646	00:40:18.710	00:40:22.740	has two of, like eyes or kidneys. To avoid wrong-site
647	00:40:22.750	00:40:26.720	surgery, a national hospital oversight body, the Joint Commission for
648	00:40:26.730	00:40:31.580	Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, now requires that the correct surgical
649	00:40:31.590	00:40:35.320	site be clearly marked. But Bagian says that when VA
650	00:40:35.330	00:40:39.830	performed root cause analysis, it discovered an even bigger problem.
651	00:40:39.840	00:40:43.230	We found out that 44% of incorrect surgeries--that's what
652	00:40:43.240	00:40:45.520	we call them; we don't call them wrong-sited, because that's
653	00:40:45.530	00:40:50.110	not right--44 percent were left/right foul-ups; 36 percent were
654	00:40:50.120	00:40:52.460	the wrong patient. The reason they did the wrong knee
655	00:40:52.470	00:40:55.750	was they thought I was you. The solution was to
656	00:40:55.760	00:40:58.760	adopt a protocol in which each patient to be operated
657	00:40:58.770	00:41:02.410	on first identifies himself by name, birth date and Social
658	00:41:02.420	00:41:06.540	Security number. William Dreyer. Okay, and your birth date? February
659	00:41:06.550	00:41:10.940	10th, 1947. Okay, and your Social Security number? We watched
660	00:41:10.950	00:41:14.110	the process take place before a real-life surgery at the
661	00:41:14.120	00:41:18.000	Washington, DC Veterans' Medical Center. Bagian says that when these
662	00:41:18.010	00:41:22.420	procedures have been followed at VA, they've drastically reduced wrong-site
663	00:41:22.430	00:41:26.450	or wrong-person surgery. Another change from the past is that
664	00:41:26.460	00:41:30.050	the VA now relies heavily on information technology to thwart
665	00:41:30.060	00:41:35.110	errors, especially those involving medication. Studies suggest those turn up
666	00:41:35.120	00:41:38.550	in roughly one out of every six hospital stays throughout
667	00:41:38.560	00:41:42.020	the U.S. As a result, the VA has shifted to
668	00:41:42.030	00:41:46.870	an almost fully computerized medication system. Physicians first select the
669	00:41:46.880	00:41:49.100	name of the drug they want to prescribe, and the
670	00:41:49.110	00:41:53.530	correct dose, from a computerized menu. That prevents any mistakes
671	00:41:53.540	00:41:57.760	stemming from doctors' often unreadable handwriting. The physician can then
672	00:41:57.770	00:42:02.110	check the prescription against the patient's fully electronic health record
673	00:42:02.120	00:42:06.540	to probe any concerns about allergies or adverse drug interactions.
674	00:42:06.550	00:42:08.690	The VA is the first large health system in the
675	00:42:08.700	00:42:13.590	nation to replace paper charts with this fully electronic record.
676	00:42:13.600	00:42:16.240	The VA spent more than a billion dollars developing the
677	00:42:16.250	00:42:19.700	record, but it now costs just $78 per patient per
678	00:42:19.710	00:42:23.450	year to operate, and Perlin says it produces a huge
679	00:42:23.460	00:42:27.120	safety payoff. If you came for care in VA eight
680	00:42:27.130	00:42:30.650	years ago, the likelihood that your chart would be there
681	00:42:30.660	00:42:34.840	would be 60 percent. Today, it's 100 percent. Once a
682	00:42:34.850	00:42:38.390	prescription order is checked against the electronic health record, it's
683	00:42:38.400	00:42:41.960	routed to the hospital pharmacy, where medication is labeled with
684	00:42:41.970	00:42:45.730	the patient's name and a unique barcode. That's an innovation
685	00:42:45.740	00:42:48.740	dreamed up by a VA nurse, who saw the barcoding
686	00:42:48.750	00:42:52.250	technology in use at a car rental agency and suggested
687	00:42:52.260	00:42:55.840	it could be adapted by the VA. The nurse scans
688	00:42:55.850	00:42:58.100	the barcode on the medication, scans the barcode on the
689	00:42:58.110	00:43:01.490	patient's wrist band, assuring that it's the right medication in
690	00:43:01.500	00:43:04.430	the right dose for the right patient, and virtually eliminating
691	00:43:04.440	00:43:07.580	errors at that point of administration. On the day we
692	00:43:07.590	00:43:11.790	visited the Washington VA, Inpatient Charles Hilliard was getting his
693	00:43:11.800	00:43:15.580	medicine for leukemia. There was two Hilliards on this floor,
694	00:43:15.590	00:43:19.700	so I definitely don't want to get his medicines, and
695	00:43:19.710	00:43:27.310	I imagine he didn't want to get mine either! The
696	00:43:27.320	00:43:31.190	VA now plans to add barcoding technology to lab work
697	00:43:31.200	00:43:34.960	to prevent mixups in which one patient's specimens are confused
698	00:43:34.970	00:43:38.270	with another's. With the exception of the costly step of
699	00:43:38.280	00:43:41.650	converting to electronic health records, most of these changes have
700	00:43:41.660	00:43:45.780	come cheaply. They amount to ten cents for every $100
701	00:43:45.790	00:43:49.100	the VA spends on delivering medical care. A new report
702	00:43:49.110	00:43:53.220	from the Government Accountability Office, Congress's watchdog arm, gives the
703	00:43:53.230	00:43:56.750	VA generally high marks for its safety initiatives. At the
704	00:43:56.760	00:44:01.290	same time, the report urges even broader cultural changes. Among
705	00:44:01.300	00:44:05.550	other things, it said, "Nurses need the confidence to disagree
706	00:44:05.560	00:44:10.490	with physicians when they find an unsafe situation." VA officials
707	00:44:10.500	00:44:14.400	agree and say they've already launched training programs to encourage
708	00:44:14.410	00:44:17.830	nurses to do just that. They say that's just one
709	00:44:17.840	00:44:21.770	way they're aiming for still higher levels of patient safety
710	00:44:21.780	00:44:25.150	and setting a standard for other U.S. health care providers
711	00:44:25.160	00:44:39.780	to follow. And finally tonight, another Super Bowl is history.
712	00:44:39.790	00:44:45.970	Media correspondent Terence Smith looks at this uniquely American spectacle.
713	00:44:45.980	00:44:49.000	First down from the 19--McNabb goes toward the end
714	00:44:49.010	00:44:52.240	zone. This one is picked off. It was that rarity
715	00:44:52.250	00:44:56.390	among Super Bowls--a closely fought game tied after the
716	00:44:56.400	00:45:04.640	first, second and third quarters. Touchdown, Philadelphia! After Philadelphia fell
717	00:45:04.650	00:45:07.900	behind by ten in the fourth, receiver Greg Lewis caught
718	00:45:07.910	00:45:14.250	a touchdown pass with 1:48 left to shave New England's
719	00:45:14.260	00:45:18.760	lead to three. But the Patriots intercepted a Donovan McNabb
720	00:45:18.770	00:45:22.320	pass with seconds to go and earned their third title
721	00:45:22.330	00:45:26.330	in four years, leading many sportswriters to brand the Patriots
722	00:45:26.340	00:45:30.330	the league's new dynasty. The Patriots became one of only
723	00:45:30.340	00:45:34.070	two teams since the 1990s to win three titles in
724	00:45:34.080	00:45:38.860	four seasons. An estimated 86 million people across the United
725	00:45:38.870	00:45:43.740	States watched the televised game according to Neilson Media Research
726	00:45:43.750	00:45:46.320	and as important to some viewers as the contest on
727	00:45:46.330	00:45:54.640	the field, the ads, and the halftime show. Former Beatle
728	00:45:54.650	00:45:59.830	Paul McCartney's halftime performance was deliberately devoid of scandal, unlike
729	00:45:59.840	00:46:04.280	last year's spectacle when Janet Jackson flashed her bare breast--
730	00:46:04.290	00:46:08.860	the now infamous "wardrobe malfunction"--when singer Justin Timberlake tore
731	00:46:08.870	00:46:13.320	open her black leather top. That fleeting moment provoked outrage
732	00:46:13.330	00:46:20.270	from the NFL to the Federal Communications Commission to Congress.
733	00:46:20.280	00:46:23.180	Hey there's some Bud Light. This year, advertisers paid an
734	00:46:23.190	00:46:28.540	average of $2.4 million to air 30-second spots specially produced
735	00:46:28.550	00:46:32.270	for the game. The raciest ad mocked the Janet Jackson
736	00:46:32.280	00:46:35.770	moment by showing an attractive woman suffering a wardrobe malfunction
737	00:46:35.780	00:46:38.920	of her own in a Senate hearing about decency over
738	00:46:38.930	00:46:42.970	the airwaves. But overall, the ads, the halftime show and
739	00:46:42.980	00:46:49.340	the game itself were decidedly family-friendly. More now about the
740	00:46:49.350	00:46:52.480	Patriots and the tone behind this year's Super Bowl. For
741	00:46:52.490	00:46:56.260	that I'm joined by author and sportswriter John Feinstein. He
742	00:46:56.270	00:46:59.820	is at work on a book about the Baltimore Ravens.
743	00:46:59.830	00:47:04.000	John, welcome. Just good, clean fun this year. That's what
744	00:47:04.010	00:47:08.780	the NFL wants. Paul Tagliabue wants a G-rated league, at
745	00:47:08.790	00:47:12.370	least on the surface of it because what he says
746	00:47:12.380	00:47:14.830	is, you know, we were shocked and outraged by the
747	00:47:14.840	00:47:17.600	Janet Jackson moment last year. You remember the Monday night
748	00:47:17.610	00:47:21.160	broadcast that opened with Nicolette Sheridan in a towel in
749	00:47:21.170	00:47:24.660	the Philadelphia Eagles' locker room with Terrell Owens. When people
750	00:47:24.670	00:47:28.760	objected to that Tagliabue again did his Inspector No imitation,
751	00:47:28.770	00:47:30.840	and said I'm shocked to learn that there are towels
752	00:47:30.850	00:47:34.700	in the Philadelphia Eagles' locker room occupied by women. They
753	00:47:34.710	00:47:37.170	go on and on about how they want to be
754	00:47:37.180	00:47:39.690	good, clean fun as you say. But look at any
755	00:47:39.700	00:47:42.910	NFL game on the sidelines; you have cheerleaders wearing almost
756	00:47:42.920	00:47:46.790	nothing. The teams put out calendars with these cheerleaders and
757	00:47:46.800	00:47:48.900	Paul Tagliabue doesn't seem to be too upset about that
758	00:47:48.910	00:47:52.030	because it sells. But for the Super Bowl, for this
759	00:47:52.040	00:47:57.680	huge audience 86 million people different rules apply. After last
760	00:47:57.690	00:48:00.530	year. Different rules apply because what the NFL had done
761	00:48:00.540	00:48:02.990	was the halftimes had gotten a little bit racier each
762	00:48:03.000	00:48:06.160	and every year. One year it was Diana Ross being
763	00:48:06.170	00:48:08.320	picked up by a helicopter and being taken out of
764	00:48:08.330	00:48:10.820	the stadium at halftime. They turned the show over to
765	00:48:10.830	00:48:14.820	MTV. Last year we saw what happened with Justin Timberlake
766	00:48:14.830	00:48:17.590	and Janet Jackson and all the reaction and the FCC
767	00:48:17.600	00:48:21.930	fining CBS hundreds of thousands of dollars for the incident
768	00:48:21.940	00:48:23.700	and then the NFL saying, okay, we're not going to
769	00:48:23.710	00:48:26.710	have that anymore so Paul McCartney is brought in. I'm
770	00:48:26.720	00:48:28.990	sure if he had wanted to sing "Why Don't We
771	00:48:29.000	00:48:31.270	Do it in the Road" that would have been banned
772	00:48:31.280	00:48:35.710	by the NFL from the halftime show. Even the advertisers
773	00:48:35.720	00:48:38.340	were on their best behavior. There was a little raciness
774	00:48:38.350	00:48:41.780	there as we just showed. But that got pulled. That
775	00:48:41.790	00:48:44.880	ad was pulled. It was supposed to air again at
776	00:48:44.890	00:48:49.650	the two-minute warning. The NFL sent word to Fox that
777	00:48:49.660	00:48:52.190	one goes too far. It was pulled. There was an
778	00:48:52.200	00:48:56.210	ad involving Mickey Rooney that was screened before the Super
779	00:48:56.220	00:48:59.800	Bowl in which his bottom was bared for two seconds.
780	00:48:59.810	00:49:03.080	Fox well aware of the FCC big brother looking over
781	00:49:03.090	00:49:05.780	its shoulder as it has done, as it did under
782	00:49:05.790	00:49:09.230	Michael Powell, saying, oh, no, we can't air that. It
783	00:49:09.240	00:49:13.770	wasn't that the advertisers necessarily wanted to tone down. They
784	00:49:13.780	00:49:16.090	had no choice but to tone down. I think you
785	00:49:16.100	00:49:20.780	call it censorship. There's a little suggestion that people, organizations,
786	00:49:20.790	00:49:24.430	networks, the NFL are perhaps having or trying to have
787	00:49:24.440	00:49:27.090	it anyway both ways. Oh, absolutely. They want to have
788	00:49:27.100	00:49:29.820	it both ways. When you go to an NFL stadium,
789	00:49:29.830	00:49:32.440	Terry, you look around. There is a sign for the
790	00:49:32.450	00:49:35.970	foundation of every player on the team. The Terence Smith
791	00:49:35.980	00:49:38.850	Foundation, the John Feinstein Foundation; if you pick up a
792	00:49:38.860	00:49:41.510	media guide it's about all the time these football players
793	00:49:41.520	00:49:44.790	spend away from the field helping kids, helping the needy.
794	00:49:44.800	00:49:47.740	That's the image the NFL portrays. The United Way commercials
795	00:49:47.750	00:49:50.290	that have run for years with the players standing there
796	00:49:50.300	00:49:52.590	going in my free time I go and I help
797	00:49:52.600	00:49:54.990	these people who are in need. That's the image the
798	00:49:55.000	00:49:58.010	NFL wants but they also know, they're smart enough to
799	00:49:58.020	00:50:01.740	know that sex sells. So when they can get away
800	00:50:01.750	00:50:05.590	with it, with cheerleaders rah-rah but we're wearing almost nothing
801	00:50:05.600	00:50:07.960	they do that too. Now, in fact they got a
802	00:50:07.970	00:50:12.180	huge audience, 86 million people, but interestingly that was down
803	00:50:12.190	00:50:15.230	4 percent from a year ago. You wonder if that's
804	00:50:15.240	00:50:17.320	just a blip, if it's a reflection of the fact
805	00:50:17.330	00:50:19.250	that the weather was pretty good on the East Coast
806	00:50:19.260	00:50:22.050	and people were out late in the afternoon. The ratings
807	00:50:22.060	00:50:24.930	go up as the game goes on. Maybe people are
808	00:50:24.940	00:50:26.880	a little tired of the Patriots. You never know with
809	00:50:26.890	00:50:29.590	dynasties. They can go both ways. The Patriots aren't a
810	00:50:29.600	00:50:33.550	sexy dynasty the way the Cowboys were. The cowboys were
811	00:50:33.560	00:50:36.110	rock 'em, sock 'em, they were America's team. They had
812	00:50:36.120	00:50:38.810	the sexy cheerleaders that everybody knew all about because they
813	00:50:38.820	00:50:42.640	were the first ones to have them. They got big
814	00:50:42.650	00:50:46.430	ratings. The Patriots are a very quiet dynasty, embodied in
815	00:50:46.440	00:50:49.840	their coach Bill Belichick who would rather wear a gray
816	00:50:49.850	00:50:54.290	sweat shirt 24/7 throughout the year. Dynasty, what does it
817	00:50:54.300	00:51:01.170	mean? That's today's word. It's a relative word in anything.
818	00:51:01.180	00:51:04.630	In sports, politics, whatever you want to talk about. But
819	00:51:04.640	00:51:08.730	in today's NFL, where you have this salary cap that
820	00:51:08.740	00:51:12.140	makes it very difficult to keep teams together for extended
821	00:51:12.150	00:51:15.250	periods because players become stars and then their salaries go
822	00:51:15.260	00:51:17.150	up and teams have to make a decision, we can
823	00:51:17.160	00:51:19.640	pay this star but we can't pay that star. So
824	00:51:19.650	00:51:23.100	it's very hard to maintain year after year the way
825	00:51:23.110	00:51:25.210	in the old days when players were tied to their
826	00:51:25.220	00:51:27.790	teams forever, you know, the old Green Bay Packers of
827	00:51:27.800	00:51:30.780	Vince Lombardi, most of those guys stayed with the Packers
828	00:51:30.790	00:51:33.630	for their entire careers. It doesn't work that way anymore
829	00:51:33.640	00:51:36.540	in the NFL. So to win three Super Bowls in
830	00:51:36.550	00:51:40.760	four years in today's environment is remarkable and is, quote
831	00:51:40.770	00:51:43.650	unquote, a dynasty. Yet they have figured out how to
832	00:51:43.660	00:51:46.480	do it. What's the key? Well I think the key
833	00:51:46.490	00:51:49.880	for the Patriots--That's what I mean.--is they are
834	00:51:49.890	00:51:53.290	not built around superstars. Their one true superstar, the one
835	00:51:53.300	00:51:55.750	guy on this team who is a lock Hall of
836	00:51:55.760	00:51:58.350	Famer is their quarterback Tom Brady. They took him with
837	00:51:58.360	00:52:02.220	199th pick in the NFL draft in the sixth round.
838	00:52:02.230	00:52:05.020	Not the number one like Peyton Manning of the Colts
839	00:52:05.030	00:52:08.250	or Troy Aikman who was the quarterback for the last
840	00:52:08.260	00:52:11.280	dynasty for the Cowboys. He was the 199th pick. So
841	00:52:11.290	00:52:14.660	there's some luck involved when you get a superstar in
842	00:52:14.670	00:52:17.260	the sixth round but what they have done is they
843	00:52:17.270	00:52:21.590	have built with mid-level free agents, guys who don't make
844	00:52:21.600	00:52:25.520	12, 14, 15 million dollars a year. There's a saying
845	00:52:25.530	00:52:28.290	around the NFL the Washington Redskins win the Super Bowl
846	00:52:28.300	00:52:30.880	every March because they march in all these big money
847	00:52:30.890	00:52:33.300	free agents hold up a jersey gave them the huge
848	00:52:33.310	00:52:35.770	contracts. When they have to put the team on the
849	00:52:35.780	00:52:39.870	field in September it doesn't go so well. The Patriots
850	00:52:39.880	00:52:42.120	don't hold any of those press conferences in March. Their
851	00:52:42.130	00:52:45.840	signings are in agate. They sign so-and-so off of a
852	00:52:45.850	00:52:48.830	team for, you know, for $2 million a year which
853	00:52:48.840	00:52:51.670	in relative terms is a small contract. Then you look
854	00:52:51.680	00:52:54.600	up in January and they're playing and the Redskins are
855	00:52:54.610	00:52:57.190	watching at home along with most other teams. If that's
856	00:52:57.200	00:53:00.040	the formula why couldn't other teams do it? Why don't
857	00:53:00.050	00:53:02.430	other teams do it? Well, other teams are copying it
858	00:53:02.440	00:53:06.090	now because they're seeing how it works. You will see,
859	00:53:06.100	00:53:08.500	you have seen in the last couple of years more
860	00:53:08.510	00:53:11.710	and more teams looking for those mid-level free agents to
861	00:53:11.720	00:53:14.910	fill out around their stars. But it's easier said than
862	00:53:14.920	00:53:17.420	done. You have to have great scouts. The Patriots have
863	00:53:17.430	00:53:20.110	a great front office led by Scott Pioli, a man
864	00:53:20.120	00:53:22.430	who has been with Bill Belichick the coach since the
865	00:53:22.440	00:53:26.490	cradle essentially and who Belichick has kept there. There are
866	00:53:26.500	00:53:28.040	a lot of teams that would like to hire Scott
867	00:53:28.050	00:53:30.120	Pioli as their general manager and Belichick said, no, no,
868	00:53:30.130	00:53:32.220	you're not going anywhere; I'm going to pay you more
869	00:53:32.230	00:53:34.770	but you're staying with me. So that's part of the
870	00:53:34.780	00:53:38.530	secret. The other part is Belichick. The guy learned from
871	00:53:38.540	00:53:42.310	his failures. The smartest people learn from their failures. He
872	00:53:42.320	00:53:44.920	was a failure in Cleveland. He missed the playoffs four
873	00:53:44.930	00:53:47.020	years out of five, he got fired. He learned from
874	00:53:47.030	00:54:02.300	that. John Feinstein, thanks so much. Thank you, Terry. Again,
875	00:54:02.310	00:54:05.210	the other major developments of this day: President Bush sent
876	00:54:05.220	00:54:09.380	a $2.5 trillion budget to Congress. Democratic leaders called it
877	00:54:09.390	00:54:13.110	a hoax. Israel and the Palestinians announced plans for a
878	00:54:13.120	00:54:16.920	formal ceasefire. And at least 28 people died in attacks
879	00:54:16.930	00:54:20.750	across Iraq. We'll see you online and again here tomorrow
880	00:54:20.760	01:04:06.164	evening. I'm Jim Lehrer. Thank you and good night.
