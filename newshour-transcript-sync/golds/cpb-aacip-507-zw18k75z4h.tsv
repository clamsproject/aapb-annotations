1	00:01:21.710	00:01:24.880	Good evening, and Happy New Year. Today marks the first
2	00:01:24.890	00:01:27.170	day for a lot of things, but in one industry
3	00:01:27.180	00:01:30.430	in particular -- an industry that touches all our lives -- today
4	00:01:30.440	00:01:33.310	is the beginning of a brave new world, the industry
5	00:01:33.320	00:01:35.990	is banking, which is about to be revolutionized by a
6	00:01:36.000	00:01:40.000	lifting of government regulations beginning today, making the business more
7	00:01:40.010	00:01:44.090	competitive, blurring the distinctions between commercial banks and savings and
8	00:01:44.100	00:01:48.600	loan associations. The changes are designed to benefit the consumer,
9	00:01:48.610	00:01:50.690	but it may be a long time before the dust
10	00:01:50.700	00:01:54.500	settles enough to make clear just who gains. Many savings
11	00:01:54.510	00:01:57.810	and loan people think that deregulation is rigged against them
12	00:01:57.820	00:02:00.860	in favor of the big commercial banks. Some fear the
13	00:02:00.870	00:02:03.980	competition will wipe out many savings and loans and dry
14	00:02:03.990	00:02:07.050	up money for house mortgages. What is clear is that
15	00:02:07.060	00:02:10.890	a fierce battle for banking profit and survival lies ahead
16	00:02:10.900	00:02:13.170	and that`s what we consider tonight -- the battle of the
17	00:02:13.180	00:02:17.320	banks. Jim? Robin, the specific changes that go into effect
18	00:02:17.330	00:02:20.900	today are these. Banks, all kinds -- savings and loans, mutual
19	00:02:20.910	00:02:24.490	savings associations included -- can now offer checking accounts, and they
20	00:02:24.500	00:02:27.110	can pay interest on the money in those accounts; that`s
21	00:02:27.120	00:02:31.000	the so-called NOW account. The maximum interest an institution can
22	00:02:31.010	00:02:34.010	pay today is 5 1/4 percent, but over the next
23	00:02:34.020	00:02:36.750	six years that also is going to gradually change. Under
24	00:02:36.760	00:02:40.630	the guidance of a six-member deregulation board all interest ceilings
25	00:02:40.640	00:02:44.060	on all accounts will be eliminated by 1986 and thus
26	00:02:44.070	00:02:47.410	be subject to the open competitive market. Also, the board
27	00:02:47.420	00:02:51.290	has already eliminated the 1/4 percent more differential that savings
28	00:02:51.300	00:02:54.730	and loans can pay for savings certificates; the differential on
29	00:02:54.740	00:02:58.450	passbook savings may soon follow. To compensate for this, savings
30	00:02:58.460	00:03:01.150	and loans can now enter the full consumer loan market,
31	00:03:01.160	00:03:04.590	make car loans, issue credit cards, broaden their investments from
32	00:03:04.600	00:03:07.240	home mortgages and do other things that in the past
33	00:03:07.250	00:03:10.810	only commercial banks could do. All of these changes and
34	00:03:10.820	00:03:13.920	more are contained in a new law called the Depository
35	00:03:13.930	00:03:19.050	Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980. It passed
36	00:03:19.060	00:03:23.560	Congress last March. It passed into practice today. Robin? For
37	00:03:23.570	00:03:26.130	a view of what the new competitive world of banking
38	00:03:26.140	00:03:29.090	may mean to consumers, we turn to Marshall Loeb, managing
39	00:03:29.100	00:03:32.740	editor of Money Magazine. Mr. Loeb, how will the new
40	00:03:32.750	00:03:37.190	laws benefit ordinary banks customers? The new laws, Robin, mean
41	00:03:37.200	00:03:41.660	more competition and more choice; and as there is competition
42	00:03:41.670	00:03:45.530	and choice, of course it will be helpful to people
43	00:03:45.540	00:03:48.660	who are coming closer now to one-stop banking where you
44	00:03:48.670	00:03:51.600	can go to one institution, get your mortgage, get your
45	00:03:51.610	00:03:55.510	credit card, have your checking account which will draw interest,
46	00:03:55.520	00:03:59.410	have your savings account as well. The other major factor
47	00:03:59.420	00:04:02.030	is that those of us who have had checking accounts
48	00:04:02.040	00:04:04.950	and have had our money in there drawing no money
49	00:04:04.960	00:04:08.310	on it will now get interest upon those deposits if
50	00:04:08.320	00:04:12.020	we choose. Could you describe one type of bank customer
51	00:04:12.030	00:04:15.270	who will benefit most from the new competition? Probably that
52	00:04:15.280	00:04:19.090	customer who has got a fairly large checking account because
53	00:04:19.100	00:04:23.590	if your account drops below a certain so-called minimum balance,
54	00:04:23.600	00:04:26.600	then you will have to pay either a fee or
55	00:04:26.610	00:04:29.880	a charge per check or both. Now, that minimum balance
56	00:04:29.890	00:04:33.730	will vary bank by bank. In general it will be
57	00:04:33.740	00:04:39.110	from $500 to $2,500, in some cases as much as
58	00:04:39.120	00:04:43.760	$3,000. If you have a fairly large account, you will
59	00:04:43.770	00:04:48.550	be drawing interest with no penalty on your checking deposits.
60	00:04:48.560	00:04:52.720	These NOW accounts have been in practice now in New
61	00:04:52.730	00:04:55.220	Jersey and New York for -- And six New England states.
62	00:04:55.230	00:04:56.840	-- and six New England states, for a couple of years.
63	00:04:56.850	00:04:59.220	How have they worked out? I mean, are customers really
64	00:04:59.230	00:05:02.300	benefiting from them? Those, of course, who have had their
65	00:05:02.310	00:05:06.270	money in such accounts have indeed benefited. But at least
66	00:05:06.280	00:05:09.790	they have had the choice. Anybody who now can make
67	00:05:09.800	00:05:15.180	that decision can determine for himself if his financial situation
68	00:05:15.190	00:05:18.100	is such that it pays him to go into a
69	00:05:18.110	00:05:20.550	NOW account. I would argue that it is much better
70	00:05:20.560	00:05:23.670	to have that choice than not to have the choice.
71	00:05:23.680	00:05:29.330	How will raising, and six years later eliminating, the ceiling
72	00:05:29.340	00:05:31.640	on interest that can be paid on savings accounts, how
73	00:05:31.650	00:05:35.470	is that going to help people? Well, the -- that certainly
74	00:05:35.480	00:05:38.360	will help people in that they will be getting more
75	00:05:38.370	00:05:41.990	of a market rate or a competitive rate for their
76	00:05:42.000	00:05:47.060	savings deposits. Now, I would argue, there is discrimination. People,
77	00:05:47.070	00:05:50.670	mostly small savers who have their money in savings banks,
78	00:05:50.680	00:05:54.010	get federal limits on the amount of interest they may
79	00:05:54.020	00:05:58.380	draw. Those who have larger sums of money can put
80	00:05:58.390	00:06:03.250	them in money market funds or other instruments that would
81	00:06:03.260	00:06:06.180	pay much higher interest. So this brings the small saver
82	00:06:06.190	00:06:09.610	up level with the personal? Very gradually it will bring
83	00:06:09.620	00:06:14.550	the small saver up. Indeed, now in savings institutions you
84	00:06:14.560	00:06:18.570	get only 5¼ to 5½ percent on your savings. What
85	00:06:18.580	00:06:20.840	about negative effects? Some people, as I said in the
86	00:06:20.850	00:06:23.780	beginning, in savings and loan fear that mortgage money is
87	00:06:23.790	00:06:25.830	going to dry up as a result of this, because
88	00:06:25.840	00:06:28.460	they won`t do well and therefore the natural source of
89	00:06:28.470	00:06:31.120	mortgage money won`t happen. The savings and loan people are
90	00:06:31.130	00:06:35.650	very worried that the elimination of the one-quarter-point differential -- which
91	00:06:35.660	00:06:40.550	of course will not happen for five years -- will be
92	00:06:40.560	00:06:43.370	very hurtful to them, and of course the savings and
93	00:06:43.380	00:06:48.470	loan institutions are so important in mortgage finance. However, I
94	00:06:48.480	00:06:51.440	think there is a strong case that what is hurting
95	00:06:51.450	00:06:55.560	the mortgage market in this country is just the competition
96	00:06:55.570	00:06:59.500	from all sorts of other instruments that pay much higher
97	00:06:59.510	00:07:04.740	interest than savings and loan institutions now pay. Just consider
98	00:07:04.750	00:07:07.830	the enormous growth of money market funds, some of which
99	00:07:07.840	00:07:11.900	pay 12 percent and now in a few instances even
100	00:07:11.910	00:07:16.980	more. Certainly they are drawing huge sums away from those
101	00:07:16.990	00:07:21.230	institutions that would now pay only 5 1/2 percent. Well
102	00:07:21.240	00:07:23.920	thank you. Jim? There are those in the savings and
103	00:07:23.930	00:07:27.120	loan business crying foul over all of this deregulation. They
104	00:07:27.130	00:07:29.180	claim they`ve been set up to be had by the
105	00:07:29.190	00:07:31.640	big commercial banks. John Hardin is one of those who
106	00:07:31.650	00:07:34.480	think so. He`s president of the First Federal Savings and
107	00:07:34.490	00:07:37.180	Loan in Rock Hill, South Carolina, and he`s the former
108	00:07:37.190	00:07:40.400	president of his industry`s trade association, the U.S. League of
109	00:07:40.410	00:07:44.600	Savings Associations. What are you upset about, Mr. Hardin? Well,
110	00:07:44.610	00:07:47.570	we`ve been caught in quite a squeeze. You see, we`ve --
111	00:07:47.580	00:07:49.960	all of our loans in the past have been on
112	00:07:49.970	00:07:53.630	a fixed rate, and now when the escalation of money
113	00:07:53.640	00:07:56.820	has gone up so fast, Mr. Lehrer, we are not
114	00:07:56.830	00:07:59.490	in a position to keep up with it as my
115	00:07:59.500	00:08:03.170	friends in the commercial banking area. And we are supposed
116	00:08:03.180	00:08:05.720	to be putting all of our -- most of our funds
117	00:08:05.730	00:08:08.630	into mortgage loans. As a matter of fact, this country
118	00:08:08.640	00:08:12.230	is a country of homeowners mainly because of savings and
119	00:08:12.240	00:08:14.920	loans. We have made the bulk of the home loans
120	00:08:14.930	00:08:18.410	for the last 150 years. This is the thing we
121	00:08:18.420	00:08:21.150	want to continue to do. We want our business to
122	00:08:21.160	00:08:26.090	be basically centered toward home ownership in this country. What
123	00:08:26.100	00:08:27.990	will prevent you from doing that? Well, right now we`re
124	00:08:28.000	00:08:32.240	paying, for instance, 15.6 percent for savings, on money market
125	00:08:32.250	00:08:36.520	certificates, trying to be competitive, where our mortgage rate that
126	00:08:36.530	00:08:40.640	we`re receiving is only 15¼, and of course this can`t
127	00:08:40.650	00:08:45.210	go on. The high interest rates in the country -- and
128	00:08:45.220	00:08:48.310	I`m delighted that Senator Garn is here, because he has
129	00:08:48.320	00:08:50.280	been a great -- He`s the incoming chairman of the banking
130	00:08:50.290	00:08:50.850	committee. We`re going to talk to him in a moment.
131	00:08:50.860	00:08:54.090	Yes indeed. And he`s done a great deal to help
132	00:08:54.100	00:08:57.580	us and we`re looking forward to one specific thing, and
133	00:08:57.590	00:09:00.690	that is, an incentive for savings for the people of
134	00:09:00.700	00:09:03.790	this country, some type -- right now we have a $200
135	00:09:03.800	00:09:09.600	and a $400 tax-free savings. We -- he, I think, is
136	00:09:09.610	00:09:13.210	in favor of $1,000 and $2,000, or something of that
137	00:09:13.220	00:09:16.400	nature. This would be of tremendous effect. But what about
138	00:09:16.410	00:09:19.170	the savings and loan? I mean, under the -- where deregulation
139	00:09:19.180	00:09:20.980	is going, everybody`s going to be free to compete. Well,
140	00:09:20.990	00:09:25.430	I was interested in Mr. Loeb`s remark that the -- five
141	00:09:25.440	00:09:28.660	years from now the differential would be done away with.
142	00:09:28.670	00:09:32.570	It was done away with six weeks after the committee
143	00:09:32.580	00:09:36.650	went into effect. They were supposed to have a six-year,
144	00:09:36.660	00:09:41.540	gradual phase-out of the differential. And instead, in six weeks,
145	00:09:41.550	00:09:44.530	their first meeting, they phased the entire thing out. But
146	00:09:44.540	00:09:46.860	not for passbooks, yet. They haven`t done that yet, have
147	00:09:46.870	00:09:49.090	they? No, sir. This was where -- but where our bulk
148	00:09:49.100	00:09:51.530	of our money is coming from right now. See, we
149	00:09:51.540	00:09:54.670	are losing passbook money and it`s going into money market
150	00:09:54.680	00:09:58.650	certificates, so the cost of our money is just escalating.
151	00:09:58.660	00:10:00.960	And we really are not the ones that are getting
152	00:10:00.970	00:10:04.690	hurt as much as the homebuilder and the electrician and
153	00:10:04.700	00:10:06.780	the plumber and the painter and all of the millions
154	00:10:06.790	00:10:09.860	of people in this country that are involved in homebuilding.
155	00:10:09.870	00:10:14.420	But also, under the deregulation law aren`t you free now
156	00:10:14.430	00:10:17.330	to go out and compensate for this and get in
157	00:10:17.340	00:10:21.260	the car loan business and open checking accounts? Yes, sir.
158	00:10:21.270	00:10:24.280	But let`s take the NOW accounts they were just talking
159	00:10:24.290	00:10:28.350	about. This is really of no real help to us
160	00:10:28.360	00:10:32.440	so far as improving our profit situation. It`ll be a
161	00:10:32.450	00:10:35.400	service and we`re glad to offer it, but it will
162	00:10:35.410	00:10:38.800	not be a real profitable service. Now, we were given
163	00:10:38.810	00:10:41.780	checking accounts, so to speak, or NOW accounts, but not
164	00:10:41.790	00:10:45.340	commercial checking accounts. So in effect the savings and loans
165	00:10:45.350	00:10:49.260	were given the loss leader, you see. And where the
166	00:10:49.270	00:10:52.090	commercial banks really make money on checking accounts is in
167	00:10:52.100	00:10:55.430	the commercial accounts. We don`t have that. Well, what do
168	00:10:55.440	00:10:57.650	you think the impact of all of this is going
169	00:10:57.660	00:11:00.710	to be on your industry? Well, in the first place
170	00:11:00.720	00:11:03.340	most of our savings and loans are small, as I
171	00:11:03.350	00:11:07.570	am -- 80 percent are under $100 million in assets. And
172	00:11:07.580	00:11:11.070	they are having a difficult time adjusting to bringing out
173	00:11:11.080	00:11:14.990	all these new services: NOW accounts, consumer loans, automobile loans.
174	00:11:15.000	00:11:16.940	And we especially -- You mean, because you have to hire
175	00:11:16.950	00:11:18.400	people and all that sort of thing? Yes, sir. And
176	00:11:18.410	00:11:23.550	learn specifically how to go about making these types of
177	00:11:23.560	00:11:26.390	loans that the banks have been doing for years. You
178	00:11:26.400	00:11:28.970	see, the commercial banks were set up in this country
179	00:11:28.980	00:11:31.740	years ago to do a specific job, and they`ve done
180	00:11:31.750	00:11:34.120	a wonderful job, and I want to congratulate them. They`ve
181	00:11:34.130	00:11:37.490	kept the wheels of industry turning. We were set up
182	00:11:37.500	00:11:40.890	150 years ago to provide home ownership to the people
183	00:11:40.900	00:11:44.250	of this nation. We have done it. I`m saying -- and
184	00:11:44.260	00:11:46.990	we did it with that little tiny differential, you see.
185	00:11:47.000	00:11:50.510	One-quarter? One-quarter, to attract money into savings and loans. But
186	00:11:50.520	00:11:53.060	somehow that -- Well now, wait. Yeah. Okay. Now, if we
187	00:11:53.070	00:11:56.960	did get the money with that little differential -- the commercial
188	00:11:56.970	00:11:59.760	banks have prospered -- and I`m proud of them -- more than
189	00:11:59.770	00:12:02.240	they ever have for the past ten years or so.
190	00:12:02.250	00:12:05.200	We have done the same up until the last year.
191	00:12:05.210	00:12:07.380	So if we`re both doing our job and doing it
192	00:12:07.390	00:12:12.520	well, why rock the boat? But the ceiling`s removed. And
193	00:12:12.530	00:12:14.220	interest rates are going to go up -- in other words,
194	00:12:14.230	00:12:16.500	the interest that can be paid to people. What in
195	00:12:16.510	00:12:18.920	the world is a ¼ of a percent going to
196	00:12:18.930	00:12:22.550	do? Well, right now it`s kind of problematical. Right now,
197	00:12:22.560	00:12:27.290	under the present -- this is extreme times, with interest rates,
198	00:12:27.300	00:12:31.500	the prime rate, centered at 20 percent. We`re talking about
199	00:12:31.510	00:12:34.720	when we get back to something more normal than we`re
200	00:12:34.730	00:12:38.210	living in now, because I don`t think that anybody agrees
201	00:12:38.220	00:12:42.960	that we can continue in these types of interest-rate climate.
202	00:12:42.970	00:12:44.300	But it does make a difference, and you want it
203	00:12:44.310	00:12:47.750	back? Yes, sir. Thank you. Robin? Now the other side
204	00:12:47.760	00:12:50.560	of the picture from the perspective of the commercial banks.
205	00:12:50.570	00:12:54.400	Sandra McLoughlin is senior vice president of Pittsburgh`s Mellon Bank,
206	00:12:54.410	00:12:56.990	the 16th largest bank in the country. Ms. McLoughlin has
207	00:12:57.000	00:12:59.900	been active on committees of the American Bankers Association and
208	00:12:59.910	00:13:03.470	in lobbying on banking issues. Ms. McLoughlin, how do you
209	00:13:03.480	00:13:07.250	and your bank feel about the new environment? Well, I
210	00:13:07.260	00:13:09.720	think, Robin, if you go back awhile in time, not
211	00:13:09.730	00:13:12.100	only at the Mellon Bank but throughout the commercial banking
212	00:13:12.110	00:13:17.650	industry, it`s entirely fair to say that the changes we`re
213	00:13:17.660	00:13:22.320	seeing taking place now, effective January 1, have been in
214	00:13:22.330	00:13:26.220	the making for a very long time. I think it`s
215	00:13:26.230	00:13:28.950	entirely proper, and I think I speak for our industry --
216	00:13:28.960	00:13:31.840	I think it`s entirely proper that we begin to see
217	00:13:31.850	00:13:36.430	a phasing out of reg Q, and more attractive rates
218	00:13:36.440	00:13:40.030	for the saver. Like Mr. Hardin, we`re very concerned with
219	00:13:40.040	00:13:42.920	the low propensity to save in this country. And it
220	00:13:42.930	00:13:48.420	would seem that the savers need some market rate incentive.
221	00:13:48.430	00:13:50.340	We believe that the phasing out of reg Q will
222	00:13:50.350	00:13:55.070	do that. "Reg Q" being? Reg Q being that regulation
223	00:13:55.080	00:13:59.380	which controls the interest rates paid to savers. Yeah. How
224	00:13:59.390	00:14:02.560	do you think customers are going to benefit? I think
225	00:14:02.570	00:14:05.080	customers will benefit -- I can only agree with Mr. Loeb`s
226	00:14:05.090	00:14:08.920	earlier comments. By and large, while there are some problematic
227	00:14:08.930	00:14:12.280	dimensions, perhaps, to the changes -- by and large I think
228	00:14:12.290	00:14:15.830	it`s a good thing that customers have more choices, not
229	00:14:15.840	00:14:19.640	fewer. It seems to me that the message to consumers
230	00:14:19.650	00:14:23.590	in all of this is that -- is really twofold. One
231	00:14:23.600	00:14:28.010	is that any sum of money, however small by relative
232	00:14:28.020	00:14:31.750	standards -- any sum of money, if it`s yours, is worth
233	00:14:31.760	00:14:36.370	shopping for. It`s worth shopping different financial institutions to find
234	00:14:36.380	00:14:38.810	the best kind of use for your money, the best
235	00:14:38.820	00:14:41.340	rate you can be paid for the money. That`s point
236	00:14:41.350	00:14:45.840	one. And point two is that in fact the issues
237	00:14:45.850	00:14:49.110	are becoming more complicated. Along with the choices comes, of
238	00:14:49.120	00:14:53.210	course, added complication. That means that consumers are going to
239	00:14:53.220	00:14:56.910	probably have to pay a little closer attention to what
240	00:14:56.920	00:14:59.740	their bank is giving them versus what the competition is
241	00:14:59.750	00:15:02.540	giving them. What do you say to Mr. Hardin`s complaint
242	00:15:02.550	00:15:06.680	that the deck`s been stacked against them -- the regulators have
243	00:15:06.690	00:15:09.570	left you, the commercial banks, with the most profitable part
244	00:15:09.580	00:15:14.060	of the business, which are corporate checking accounts and loans,
245	00:15:14.070	00:15:17.720	and has given them very little? Well, I think the
246	00:15:17.730	00:15:20.050	fact is that we have been competing for a very
247	00:15:20.060	00:15:25.260	long time in the consumer lending arena, that the advent
248	00:15:25.270	00:15:28.410	of commercial banking in the consumer arena is not new
249	00:15:28.420	00:15:32.700	at all. I think it`s entirely appropriate. I believe I
250	00:15:32.710	00:15:35.510	speak for our industry in this respect. It`s entirely appropriate
251	00:15:35.520	00:15:39.460	that we now level the playing field. Just as Mr.
252	00:15:39.470	00:15:44.490	Hardin is -- has talked at some length about his unhappiness
253	00:15:44.500	00:15:47.910	at eliminating the differential for all of the reasons that
254	00:15:47.920	00:15:51.290	he might be unhappy, we see this as a plus
255	00:15:51.300	00:15:54.130	not just for commercial banks but for the consumers, because
256	00:15:54.140	00:15:57.450	at long last, once again the choices are expanded for
257	00:15:57.460	00:16:00.080	the consumer. All right. I noticed in the Wall Street
258	00:16:00.090	00:16:03.750	Journal that a Mr. W.C. Smith, a Realtor from your
259	00:16:03.760	00:16:07.830	city, Pittsburgh, said in an interview that the new law
260	00:16:07.840	00:16:10.700	was an obituary for the savings and loans. Do you
261	00:16:10.710	00:16:13.020	regard it that way? I don`t regard it that way
262	00:16:13.030	00:16:15.630	at all, Robin. It seems to me that there is
263	00:16:15.640	00:16:20.270	always room for any well-managed institution. I would have to
264	00:16:20.280	00:16:23.850	agree with Mr. Hardin that probably the savings and loans
265	00:16:23.860	00:16:27.640	have a greater adjustment to make at this juncture. On
266	00:16:27.650	00:16:31.360	the other hand, I think we`ve all, including Mr. Hardin --
267	00:16:31.370	00:16:33.450	- I think we`ve seen this coming for awhile. So there
268	00:16:33.460	00:16:37.060	has been some preparatory time. It`s not as though January
269	00:16:37.070	00:16:40.640	1, `81 we woke up on that morning and the
270	00:16:40.650	00:16:43.000	banking laws were changed. This has been in the making
271	00:16:43.010	00:16:46.640	for a good long time. All things considered, I think
272	00:16:46.650	00:16:50.490	there are - - there is room for any well-managed institution, and
273	00:16:50.500	00:16:53.580	that includes small savings and loans, just as it has
274	00:16:53.590	00:16:57.900	for years included small commercial banks. Do you expect small
275	00:16:57.910	00:17:00.930	banks and neighborhood banks to go out of business as
276	00:17:00.940	00:17:03.610	a result of the new competitive wind? I don`t at
277	00:17:03.620	00:17:06.000	all. And I think the proof of the pudding is
278	00:17:06.010	00:17:09.770	the great diversity of size of commercial banking. If you
279	00:17:09.780	00:17:12.680	start from the premise that savings and loans are now
280	00:17:12.690	00:17:17.990	moving into an arena of very much broadened consumer banking
281	00:17:18.000	00:17:20.800	powers -- if you start from that premise and now look
282	00:17:20.810	00:17:23.880	at the small commercial banks across the country, who have
283	00:17:23.890	00:17:27.930	been largely, for many years, in the consumer business, not
284	00:17:27.940	00:17:31.280	in the corporate business, then you have to assume that
285	00:17:31.290	00:17:34.610	just as small commercial banks have survived for many, many
286	00:17:34.620	00:17:38.450	years, so, too, will the savings and loans survive. What
287	00:17:38.460	00:17:41.660	I believe will happen, as has happened with small commercial
288	00:17:41.670	00:17:45.250	banks, is that with increasing frequency we will see the
289	00:17:45.260	00:17:48.250	smaller bank going to the larger bank for some automated
290	00:17:48.260	00:17:52.650	support, and for some expertise that makes it possible -- buying
291	00:17:52.660	00:17:56.520	those services, and making it thereby possible for the small
292	00:17:56.530	00:17:59.880	bank to offer the broadest possible range of services to
293	00:17:59.890	00:18:03.250	its marketplace. Well, thank you. Jim? If Congress is to
294	00:18:03.260	00:18:06.380	make any new changes or adjustments in its deregulation of
295	00:18:06.390	00:18:08.720	the financial business, it would most likely have to be
296	00:18:08.730	00:18:11.460	done with the approval and support of Senator Jake Garn,
297	00:18:11.470	00:18:14.970	Republican of Utah. As of next Monday, Senator Garn becomes
298	00:18:14.980	00:18:18.330	chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Senator, you`ve heard this
299	00:18:18.340	00:18:21.440	discussion. What`s your view of how deregulation of the banking
300	00:18:21.450	00:18:24.580	business is going so far? Jim, let me say I`ve
301	00:18:24.590	00:18:28.810	heard this discussion for six long years of committee hearings,
302	00:18:28.820	00:18:33.290	of testimony, of markups. This all did start even before
303	00:18:33.300	00:18:37.570	that, many years before that. In 1975, the Senate passed
304	00:18:37.580	00:18:40.470	the Financial Institutions Act, which was not passed by the
305	00:18:40.480	00:18:43.670	House of Representatives. And then each year the Senate has
306	00:18:43.680	00:18:48.280	passed similar legislation. The House has been reluctant. Finally, in
307	00:18:48.290	00:18:52.290	this year, through 1979 and into 1980, the House and
308	00:18:52.300	00:18:56.310	the Senate, after some long, long negotiations -- finally agreed to
309	00:18:56.320	00:18:59.530	what you have referred to as the Financial Institutions Deregulation
310	00:18:59.540	00:19:02.340	Act. It is a series of compromises. If I could
311	00:19:02.350	00:19:05.160	write it it would be quite different. But obviously when
312	00:19:05.170	00:19:07.270	you have a conference committee between the House and the
313	00:19:07.280	00:19:09.610	Senate there`s a great deal of give and take, and
314	00:19:09.620	00:19:13.740	a lot of this came out late one night. Overall,
315	00:19:13.750	00:19:16.120	I agree with it. But there are nine sections of
316	00:19:16.130	00:19:18.500	this bill. We`ve only discussed one or two. There are
317	00:19:18.510	00:19:22.930	many other things, like mandatory reserves for all financial institutions
318	00:19:22.940	00:19:26.430	now, rather than voluntary, the way I would have preferred.
319	00:19:26.440	00:19:31.920	There`s simplification of truth-in-lending. So it`s a very complex thing.
320	00:19:31.930	00:19:33.790	And I do think there will have to be some
321	00:19:33.800	00:19:36.300	adjustments made in the future. I`ve said that all along:
322	00:19:36.310	00:19:38.330	that once we came out with what appeared to be
323	00:19:38.340	00:19:40.890	a level playing field, we would find out that it
324	00:19:40.900	00:19:43.350	was not, and there were some advantages of some parts
325	00:19:43.360	00:19:46.550	of the financial community, and disadvantages. I think Congress is
326	00:19:46.560	00:19:48.150	going to have to take a look at how it
327	00:19:48.160	00:19:50.030	is working. And I do think we`ll be back with
328	00:19:50.040	00:19:52.140	amendments in the future. Do you think the savings and
329	00:19:52.150	00:19:55.290	loans people have a legitimate complaint, as Mr. Hardin outlined
330	00:19:55.300	00:19:57.740	it? What I said just before we went on the
331	00:19:57.750	00:20:00.210	air, that I thought all three segments of the financial
332	00:20:00.220	00:20:04.390	community deserved what they got, because, although individuals, like Mr.
333	00:20:04.400	00:20:07.090	Hardin, are saying exactly what they`ve said to me for
334	00:20:07.100	00:20:09.030	years -- "We don`t want to be a commercial bank; we
335	00:20:09.040	00:20:12.240	don`t want NOW accounts; we don`t want these expanded authorities"
336	00:20:12.250	00:20:15.920	-- their associations and their lobbying groups have been saying otherwise.
337	00:20:15.930	00:20:18.790	And their pressure has been very great, from the ABA,
338	00:20:18.800	00:20:21.050	from the U.S. Savings and Loan League, saying, "We want
339	00:20:21.060	00:20:23.520	to keep everything we have in the way of authority,
340	00:20:23.530	00:20:25.690	but we want a piece of what this group is
341	00:20:25.700	00:20:28.910	doing." And the credit unions wanted share drafts, and they
342	00:20:28.920	00:20:32.170	wanted expanded authorities. I don`t mean to be unkind when
343	00:20:32.180	00:20:34.600	I say they got what they deserve, but if they`d
344	00:20:34.610	00:20:37.110	been content -- But that`s what they did, right? Yeah. And
345	00:20:37.120	00:20:40.720	they`ll say, "Well, hey, they shouldn`t get what they got,
346	00:20:40.730	00:20:43.780	but we want what" -- the typical -- "our own ax is
347	00:20:43.790	00:20:48.100	being ground, or ox is being gored." And so I
348	00:20:48.110	00:20:50.080	think there are going to have to be some adjustments
349	00:20:50.090	00:20:52.550	as a result of that. But the major problem of
350	00:20:52.560	00:20:55.550	the savings and loan right now is not the deregulation
351	00:20:55.560	00:20:58.940	bill. That is minor compared to the condition of this
352	00:20:58.950	00:21:02.880	economy. And it is incredible, the cost of money -- and
353	00:21:02.890	00:21:06.310	they are, a lot of them, in great trouble, because
354	00:21:06.320	00:21:09.890	of 20 and 21 percent prime interest rates. If we
355	00:21:09.900	00:21:12.650	could get the economy back under control, get Congress under
356	00:21:12.660	00:21:17.210	control, start balancing the budget and reducing federal expenditures, and
357	00:21:17.220	00:21:19.820	get the economy in some sort of balance and level
358	00:21:19.830	00:21:23.550	playing field, I don`t think the S&Ls and other small
359	00:21:23.560	00:21:26.140	financial institutions are going to be in trouble, but they`re
360	00:21:26.150	00:21:28.550	going to be dropping like flies unless we do our
361	00:21:28.560	00:21:31.320	job. Mr. Hardin, though, is saying -- pretty much he`s saying
362	00:21:31.330	00:21:34.150	that these savings and loans cannot compete against the commercial
363	00:21:34.160	00:21:36.820	banks, and that, as he said, 80 percent of them
364	00:21:36.830	00:21:40.190	are very small, and that this business of what is
365	00:21:40.200	00:21:42.000	in the bill -- the NOW accounts and all of that --
366	00:21:42.010	00:21:42.990	- is going to cost them a lot of money and
367	00:21:43.000	00:21:44.440	it`s going to be very difficult for them. Many of
368	00:21:44.450	00:21:47.180	them may go under. That is why with regulation Q
369	00:21:47.190	00:21:51.320	being phased out, the interest rate differential, the quarter percent,
370	00:21:51.330	00:21:55.590	at the expanded authorities to give flexibility for mortgage loans
371	00:21:55.600	00:21:58.470	like commercial banks have had for years, to give them
372	00:21:58.480	00:22:01.430	NOW accounts, and to give them other authorities, to compensate
373	00:22:01.440	00:22:04.060	for the loss of that. I`m not sure yet, that
374	00:22:04.070	00:22:06.900	that does fully compensate them for that. That`s one of
375	00:22:06.910	00:22:08.480	the things we`re going to have to take a look
376	00:22:08.490	00:22:11.040	at when we see how it works. But I think
377	00:22:11.050	00:22:14.580	there`s a much bigger threat, whether it`s small banks or
378	00:22:14.590	00:22:18.810	small savings and loans, and that is the big superbanks.
379	00:22:18.820	00:22:21.460	And here we get into what we`re talking about, interstate
380	00:22:21.470	00:22:25.030	branching. And I fear in the longer run seeing ten
381	00:22:25.040	00:22:28.300	or twelve big banks in this country having thousands of
382	00:22:28.310	00:22:31.520	branches all over the country. That is the real threat,
383	00:22:31.530	00:22:34.160	in my opinion, to small savings and loans and small
384	00:22:34.170	00:22:36.460	banks. And I don`t want that to happen. I think
385	00:22:36.470	00:22:38.170	small -- But isn`t that the price you might have to
386	00:22:38.180	00:22:41.930	pay for deregulation, to leave things to the open marketplace?
387	00:22:41.940	00:22:44.840	Well, now we`re talking about something different here than taking
388	00:22:44.850	00:22:46.330	away interest rates. You`re right, and I should never have
389	00:22:46.340	00:22:49.140	asked that question. Let me give it to Robin real
390	00:22:49.150	00:22:52.860	fast. Senator. Thank you. Robin? Mr. Hardin, the Senator says
391	00:22:52.870	00:22:55.640	that your industry, perhaps not you personally, got what you
392	00:22:55.650	00:22:58.420	deserved and what your lobbying groups have been asking for.
393	00:22:58.430	00:23:01.600	Well, there`s been a great difference of opinion on that.
394	00:23:01.610	00:23:07.790	And actually the great bulk of our people have wanted
395	00:23:07.800	00:23:12.040	to remain a savings and loan in our old standard
396	00:23:12.050	00:23:14.540	of making home loans. Now, I would like to clear
397	00:23:14.550	00:23:17.520	up one thing, Jim, that you said that -- someone said
398	00:23:17.530	00:23:19.920	that maybe some of us would be going under and
399	00:23:19.930	00:23:23.130	that type of thing. A number of our associations will
400	00:23:23.140	00:23:25.820	have a difficult time and will not, say, make money
401	00:23:25.830	00:23:30.900	this year. However, this -- we have adequate reserves, I want
402	00:23:30.910	00:23:33.340	to be sure that everyone understands. We have the Federal
403	00:23:33.350	00:23:37.340	Home Loan Bank, our system, that controls us, standing behind
404	00:23:37.350	00:23:39.960	us, that has the opportunity to borrow from the Treasury,
405	00:23:39.970	00:23:44.440	to issue their own bonds. And we have the FSLIC
406	00:23:44.450	00:23:48.420	that insures each account up to $100,000. So there`s really
407	00:23:48.430	00:23:52.700	no alarm here about any of us going under. It`s
408	00:23:52.710	00:23:57.570	a matter of, can we continue to attract enough profitable
409	00:23:57.580	00:23:59.890	money in order to do the job that we were
410	00:23:59.900	00:24:02.370	put here to do? Mr. Hardin, I heard Mr. Loeb
411	00:24:02.380	00:24:05.080	agree vehemently when the Senator said a minute ago that
412	00:24:05.090	00:24:07.220	your real problem is with the state of the economy
413	00:24:07.230	00:24:07.860	and not from this act at the moment. I agree
414	00:24:07.870	00:24:11.080	with that. I agree with that a hundred percent, that
415	00:24:11.090	00:24:13.260	it -- Let`s give Mr. Loeb a chance to state it
416	00:24:13.270	00:24:15.980	here. I think we have to stress, once again, that
417	00:24:15.990	00:24:20.100	there is a major difference between deregulation and -- I find
418	00:24:20.110	00:24:24.130	it very difficult in this economy, where everybody is complaining
419	00:24:24.140	00:24:29.470	about the extreme regulation, to argue against deregulation. There is
420	00:24:29.480	00:24:33.950	a difference between deregulation and the high rates. If the
421	00:24:33.960	00:24:38.200	savings and loan associations, and the mortgage market in general,
422	00:24:38.210	00:24:41.470	are in difficulty now, it is because of the incredibly
423	00:24:41.480	00:24:44.640	high rates and the volatility of those rates, so that
424	00:24:44.650	00:24:48.590	those institutions cannot plan ahead. Will that danger be passed
425	00:24:48.600	00:24:52.090	if the rates go down soon? If the rates -- indeed,
426	00:24:52.100	00:24:55.360	if the rates go down and stay at some reasonable
427	00:24:55.370	00:25:00.480	level. We must question, of course, what is reasonable. Is --
428	00:25:00.490	00:25:03.610	when some of us are carrying 5 and 6 percent
429	00:25:03.620	00:25:06.350	mortgages from not so long ago, is a prime rate
430	00:25:06.360	00:25:10.550	of 20 or 21 percent reasonable? Is a prime rate
431	00:25:10.560	00:25:17.670	of 12 percent reasonable? Indeed, we absolutely have to get
432	00:25:17.680	00:25:21.140	this economy stable and fight the inflation in order to
433	00:25:21.150	00:25:25.430	bring down those rates. Senator Garn, Mr. Hardin said they
434	00:25:25.440	00:25:27.560	were going to fight to get that quarter percent, or
435	00:25:27.570	00:25:30.490	whatever it is, differential back. Is there any likelihood of
436	00:25:30.500	00:25:34.170	Congress restoring the differential? I would not think so. Certainly
437	00:25:34.180	00:25:38.400	not in this particular year, unless some of their predictions
438	00:25:38.410	00:25:41.320	do start to come true. But my own feeling is,
439	00:25:41.330	00:25:43.630	is that the differential will be phased out, and, as
440	00:25:43.640	00:25:46.480	I`ve said before, the most important thing we can do --
441	00:25:46.490	00:25:48.880	not only for savings and loan, but the consumers of
442	00:25:48.890	00:25:51.670	this country -- is get the economy under control. And then
443	00:25:51.680	00:25:54.070	I don`t think the quarter of a percent becomes nearly
444	00:25:54.080	00:25:56.360	as important as what they are paying -- the cost of
445	00:25:56.370	00:26:00.190	money now, with these tremendously high money market certificates. That`s
446	00:26:00.200	00:26:02.170	where -- if you look at the statistics on the savings
447	00:26:02.180	00:26:05.340	and loan, that`s where they`re losing their money for mortgages
448	00:26:05.350	00:26:09.270	to, the transfer to the money market certificates, not because
449	00:26:09.280	00:26:13.510	of the quarter percent eventually being phased out. Ms. McLoughlin,
450	00:26:13.520	00:26:16.020	on a slightly different point that the Senator also made,
451	00:26:16.030	00:26:20.930	does your bank foresee all this leading inevitably to interstate
452	00:26:20.940	00:26:25.020	branching and to a dozen or so big national banks
453	00:26:25.030	00:26:29.570	with many branches? I think we very much see on
454	00:26:29.580	00:26:35.660	the horizon some loosening, or some expansion, of branching laws.
455	00:26:35.670	00:26:38.090	And I would presume the ultimate of that would be
456	00:26:38.100	00:26:42.280	interstate branching. I don`t think we have ever seen that
457	00:26:42.290	00:26:46.440	as meaning that the small bank will disappear. I think
458	00:26:46.450	00:26:49.840	it will heighten the competition, and I think each time,
459	00:26:49.850	00:26:54.310	classically and historically, when competition is heightened in any industry
460	00:26:54.320	00:26:56.960	there are some who fall by the wayside because there
461	00:26:56.970	00:27:00.480	are some who cannot compete. But I would not see
462	00:27:00.490	00:27:04.850	the extension of branching laws or the easing of branching
463	00:27:04.860	00:27:09.400	laws as being any more devastating in that regard -- any
464	00:27:09.410	00:27:14.410	more devastating than any other kind of added competitive component.
465	00:27:14.420	00:27:18.690	And in the final analysis I believe fervently that the
466	00:27:18.700	00:27:21.690	added competition can only be good for the customers of
467	00:27:21.700	00:27:24.450	the financial institutions. You don`t see it quite that way,
468	00:27:24.460	00:27:28.140	Senator Garn? Well, this is probably not a very good
469	00:27:28.150	00:27:31.480	example. But, how many corner grocery stores do you see
470	00:27:31.490	00:27:33.370	any more? And I guess the point can be made
471	00:27:33.380	00:27:37.270	from competition from the giant supermarkets that the consumer has
472	00:27:37.280	00:27:39.840	benefited, and I`m sure there are many benefits to that.
473	00:27:39.850	00:27:42.560	But there`s also many lost benefits. At this point in
474	00:27:42.570	00:27:45.270	time, I`m not willing to give up on some tremendous
475	00:27:45.280	00:27:48.710	personal services given by small banks and savings and loan
476	00:27:48.720	00:27:51.550	and credit unions in this country, to be dominated by
477	00:27:51.560	00:27:54.420	ten or twelve huge superbanks in this country that I
478	00:27:54.430	00:27:56.490	don`t think you`ll get the same service from. I have
479	00:27:56.500	00:27:59.080	to leave it there, I`m afraid, Senator Garn. Thank you.
480	00:27:59.090	00:28:01.670	Thank you, Mr. Hardin, Ms. McLoughlin, for joining us. Mr.
481	00:28:01.680	00:28:04.000	Loeb in New York. Good night, Jim. Good night, Robin.
482	00:28:04.010	00:28:05.710	That`s all for tonight. We will be back tomorrow night.
483	00:28:05.720	00:29:32.259	I`m Robert MacNeil. Good night.
