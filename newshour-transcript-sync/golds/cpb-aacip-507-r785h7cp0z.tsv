1	00:01:45.710	00:01:49.160	Good evening. Three domestic stories occupy much of our attention
2	00:01:49.170	00:01:52.880	tonight. What does today's FCC ruling on long distance phone
3	00:01:52.890	00:01:57.270	charges mean to phone users? The state of black America.
4	00:01:57.280	00:01:59.840	The poor have been relegated to an out of sight,
5	00:01:59.850	00:02:04.290	out of mind status in American life. We talk to
6	00:02:04.300	00:02:06.690	the man making that charge, the head of the Urban
7	00:02:06.700	00:02:09.400	League. And we have an expert update on the birth
8	00:02:09.410	00:02:13.180	control pill: do the risks outweigh the benefits? Jim Lehrer's
9	00:02:13.190	00:02:17.180	off; Judy Woodruff's in Washington. Judy? Also tonight, we'll hear
10	00:02:17.190	00:02:19.990	Secretary of State Shultz explain that he didn't make much
11	00:02:20.000	00:02:23.660	headway with the Soviets on resuming arms talks. There's news
12	00:02:23.670	00:02:28.170	about the U.S. easing economic sanctions against Poland, and Argentina
13	00:02:28.180	00:02:32.340	cutting off aid to U.S.-backed rebels in Nicaragua. And finally,
14	00:02:32.350	00:02:35.690	we'll visit some American missionaries in El Salvador who work
15	00:02:35.700	00:02:41.520	behind the guerrilla lines. I'm not afraid. But I'm not
16	00:02:41.530	00:02:44.160	afraid anywhere. I'm not afraid in Cleveland, where I come
17	00:02:44.170	00:03:05.270	from. Secretary of State George Shultz said today he had
18	00:03:05.280	00:03:08.500	made no progress on reopening nuclear arms talks in his
19	00:03:08.510	00:03:13.010	five-hour session with Andrei Gromyko yesterday. Shultz arrived in Oslo
20	00:03:13.020	00:03:15.740	to brief the Norwegian government on the talks and gave
21	00:03:15.750	00:03:18.310	a press conference where he was questioned about the talks
22	00:03:18.320	00:03:21.840	with the Soviet foreign minister in Stockholm. On the question
23	00:03:21.850	00:03:24.480	of getting the Soviets to return to the two sets
24	00:03:24.490	00:03:31.010	of Geneva arms negotiations, Mr. Shultz said this. In the discussions
25	00:03:31.020	00:03:35.600	that I had with Mr. Gromyko we discussed many different
26	00:03:35.610	00:03:40.270	aspects of arms control, and insofar as the two talks
27	00:03:40.280	00:03:44.640	covering nuclear issues are concerned, I have nothing positive to
28	00:03:44.650	00:03:48.010	report to you. The Soviets have said they would not
29	00:03:48.020	00:03:50.960	return to the talks until the U.S. and NATO withdrew
30	00:03:50.970	00:03:54.740	the medium-range missiles they've begun deploying in Western Europe. Mr.
31	00:03:54.750	00:03:57.170	Shultz did say the Soviets may be getting ready to
32	00:03:57.180	00:04:01.180	reopen the East-West talks on limiting conventional forces in Europe.
33	00:04:01.190	00:04:05.330	Other Western diplomats in Stockholm said Moscow's Warsaw Pact allies
34	00:04:05.340	00:04:09.340	were suggesting that those talks resume in mid-March. Meanwhile, the
35	00:04:09.350	00:04:12.590	Soviets say they have begun deploying nuclear missiles in East
36	00:04:12.600	00:04:16.410	Germany and Czechoslovakia to counter the NATO deployments. This was
37	00:04:16.420	00:04:20.990	reported today by the Soviet army newspaper Red Star. Judy?
38	00:04:21.000	00:04:25.830	The Federal Communications Commission today tentatively postponed proposed new charges
39	00:04:25.840	00:04:29.330	on local phone bills. In so doing, in delaying the
40	00:04:29.340	00:04:34.160	so-called access fees, the FCC officials acknowledged they were cancelling
41	00:04:34.170	00:04:37.820	most, if not all, of a planned reduction in interstate
42	00:04:37.830	00:04:41.730	long distance rates. AT&T had planned to cut its long
43	00:04:41.740	00:04:45.470	distance rates by more than 10% this April, but that
44	00:04:45.480	00:04:48.100	reduction had been tied to the payment of the access
45	00:04:48.110	00:04:52.070	fees, an added $2 a month, also beginning in April.
46	00:04:52.080	00:04:54.570	The FCC said it had decided to take most of
47	00:04:54.580	00:04:57.730	this year to conduct further studies to see whether the
48	00:04:57.740	00:05:00.390	fees would force some customers to give up their phone
49	00:05:00.400	00:05:04.670	service altogether. The FCC had been under heavy pressure from
50	00:05:04.680	00:05:08.390	Congress to delay the access fees and thus eliminate any
51	00:05:08.400	00:05:11.770	need for Congress to take action to block them. Republican
52	00:05:11.780	00:05:16.480	Senator Robert Dole today applauded the FCC move. Here we're
53	00:05:16.490	00:05:19.410	faced with legislation coming from the House, saying you're going
54	00:05:19.420	00:05:21.240	to have a permanent moratorium, it's never going to take
55	00:05:21.250	00:05:24.600	effect. And you have the Packwood bill, which I'm a
56	00:05:24.610	00:05:26.950	cosponsor of, which says you're going to have a four-year
57	00:05:26.960	00:05:31.800	delay. Now, facing that, I think the commission, the Federal
58	00:05:31.810	00:05:36.440	Communications Commission, said okay, let's act on this before--and
59	00:05:36.450	00:05:40.310	avoid any need for congressional action with a one-year moratorium.
60	00:05:40.320	00:05:43.930	That's essentially what's happened. They report to Congress by December
61	00:05:43.940	00:05:47.280	1st of this year. Then there's time for comments, and
62	00:05:47.290	00:05:50.220	I would guess it'll be probably next April, May or
63	00:05:50.230	00:05:56.240	June of 1985 before any final decision is made. However,
64	00:05:56.250	00:06:00.630	AT&T, some consumer groups and another member of Congress condemned
65	00:06:00.640	00:06:04.680	the FCC decision. AT&T said it would prove a disservice
66	00:06:04.690	00:06:07.760	to the customers it is intended to help by scuttling
67	00:06:07.770	00:06:12.350	long distance rate reductions. Colorado Congressman Timothy Wirth, who chairs
68	00:06:12.360	00:06:15.980	a communications subcommittee in the House, joined with a consumer
69	00:06:15.990	00:06:20.530	research group in charging the agency with playing politics, defusing
70	00:06:20.540	00:06:23.660	the issue during an election year while sticking by its
71	00:06:23.670	00:06:27.660	ultimate goal of imposing the fees. Among others applauding the
72	00:06:27.670	00:06:32.400	FCC decision was one of AT&T's chief competitors, MCI. The
73	00:06:32.410	00:06:35.720	FCC today joined the House of Representatives, the Department of
74	00:06:35.730	00:06:39.700	Justice, the Department of Commerce and a number of members
75	00:06:39.710	00:06:42.660	of the Senate in the view that AT&T's competitors should
76	00:06:42.670	00:06:46.350	not be required to pay so much more for access
77	00:06:46.360	00:06:50.900	until equal interconnection is available to them. And that could
78	00:06:50.910	00:06:55.840	have affected the competitive vitality of this industry. The net
79	00:06:55.850	00:06:59.000	effect, I believe, will be a healthy competition in the
80	00:06:59.010	00:07:03.410	long distance market and a growing number of alternative long
81	00:07:03.420	00:07:08.300	distance competitors for the consumer. Now we look at the
82	00:07:08.310	00:07:12.480	impact of today's news about delayed access charges and the
83	00:07:12.490	00:07:16.630	fees for AT&T's long distance competitors on the phone users.
84	00:07:16.640	00:07:19.530	With us is Merrill Brown, who covers telecommunications for The
85	00:07:19.540	00:07:23.270	Washington Post. Mr. Brown, let's take the delayed access charges
86	00:07:23.280	00:07:26.940	first, the $2 monthly charge that was to be imposed
87	00:07:26.950	00:07:30.250	for access for home users on long distance lines. How
88	00:07:30.260	00:07:34.380	much is it going to save consumers? Well, certainly this
89	00:07:34.390	00:07:38.210	year it'll save consumers $2 a month from April on
90	00:07:38.220	00:07:41.800	for the rest of this year. Therefore, $18 or so.
91	00:07:41.810	00:07:44.040	But in the long run it's very hard to tell
92	00:07:44.050	00:07:46.910	because of the conflicting estimates on costs you get about
93	00:07:46.920	00:07:50.190	long distance service. Clearly on local bills, though, $2 a
94	00:07:50.200	00:07:52.880	month is the consumer saving this year. So what will
95	00:07:52.890	00:07:57.730	make the difference presumably is whether the long distance rates
96	00:07:57.740	00:08:00.420	themselves will go down, what you charge for a national
97	00:08:00.430	00:08:03.910	long distance call, not the access fee. That's right. AT&T
98	00:08:03.920	00:08:06.420	said today that it may or may not--depending on
99	00:08:06.430	00:08:09.160	how it evaluates the numbers and how it evaluates the
100	00:08:09.170	00:08:13.670	FCC's final decision--lower its rates 10%. It's unclear what
101	00:08:13.680	00:08:16.240	they're going to do. There's a faction within AT&T that
102	00:08:16.250	00:08:18.450	says perhaps they ought to, to be able to compete
103	00:08:18.460	00:08:22.570	with the other long distance carriers like MCI. I see.
104	00:08:22.580	00:08:25.070	And then there's a faction that says what? That says
105	00:08:25.080	00:08:27.020	they ought not to take the hit on their bottom
106	00:08:27.030	00:08:30.760	line, that that inevitably will bring about if they do
107	00:08:30.770	00:08:33.210	cut rates that much. Now that they are no longer
108	00:08:33.220	00:08:36.160	a monopoly and they have to compete on Wall Street
109	00:08:36.170	00:08:42.880	with--well, with their competitors. Absolutely. Now, the FCC's decision,
110	00:08:42.890	00:08:45.300	as I understand it--am I right?--does not affect
111	00:08:45.310	00:08:49.260	the $6 access charge that big business has to pay,
112	00:08:49.270	00:08:52.080	that business of a certain size will have to pay
113	00:08:52.090	00:08:54.070	to get into the long distance lines. That's still in
114	00:08:54.080	00:08:58.030	place. Businesses of any size over two lines will pay
115	00:08:58.040	00:09:01.520	$6 a month beginning this year, and that is designed
116	00:09:01.530	00:09:05.340	to try to bring about an equilibrium. Also, the business
117	00:09:05.350	00:09:08.150	community didn't have the pressure mounted on Capitol Hill that
118	00:09:08.160	00:09:10.920	consumer groups did, and they're not the political force on
119	00:09:10.930	00:09:14.630	this issue that Congress perceived phone users and residences to
120	00:09:14.640	00:09:17.230	be. There aren't as many businesses as there are individual
121	00:09:17.240	00:09:21.160	phone users and voters. Exactly. Certainly not voters. But small
122	00:09:21.170	00:09:24.510	businesses that--am I right?--who have only one, who
123	00:09:24.520	00:09:27.280	use only one phone line and were to have to
124	00:09:27.290	00:09:30.630	pay the same $2 a month access charge, they like
125	00:09:30.640	00:09:32.860	individual consumers are relieved of that, is that right? As
126	00:09:32.870	00:09:36.180	of today's decision, they're exempted, yes. Now, how are the
127	00:09:36.190	00:09:39.890	local phone companies going to make up the revenues that
128	00:09:39.900	00:09:43.610	the $2 access fee was designed to pay them to
129	00:09:43.620	00:09:46.550	replace, as I understand it, the subsidy they used to
130	00:09:46.560	00:09:50.310	get from the long distance rates? Well, Bell System officials
131	00:09:50.320	00:09:53.720	say today that that's not really a problem, because the
132	00:09:53.730	00:09:58.550	same formulas by which long distance carriers subsidize local phone
133	00:09:58.560	00:10:01.590	service, in effect, are still in effect. And AT&T and
134	00:10:01.600	00:10:03.840	the other long distance companies are going to be paying
135	00:10:03.850	00:10:07.190	those local companies the same they paid them before divestiture
136	00:10:07.200	00:10:10.750	as it was. So I don't think that that's necessarily
137	00:10:10.760	00:10:13.220	going to be the case. Local phone-rate increases need not
138	00:10:13.230	00:10:17.060	take place because of today's decision. And even if proposals
139	00:10:17.070	00:10:19.680	are made to do so, state regulators can reject them
140	00:10:19.690	00:10:23.930	as they've been rejecting local phone-rate increases all year. Now,
141	00:10:23.940	00:10:27.830	why, if this is good for consumers, as Senator Dole
142	00:10:27.840	00:10:31.600	and the head of MCI we just heard say it
143	00:10:31.610	00:10:38.010	was, why are people like Nader's Congress Watch, a consumer
144	00:10:38.020	00:10:40.890	group, and Tim Wirth, a congressional Democrat who's been very
145	00:10:40.900	00:10:43.590	involved in this--why are they against this? Well, they
146	00:10:43.600	00:10:46.720	don't like the whole concept of access charges, basically. They
147	00:10:46.730	00:10:49.700	think it unfairly distributes the burden of the costs in
148	00:10:49.710	00:10:52.880	the phone system too much onto residential users. They say
149	00:10:52.890	00:10:55.600	that's unfair, and they'd like to see a permanent ban
150	00:10:55.610	00:10:59.190	on access charges put into place. Next year--As the
151	00:10:59.200	00:11:01.970	House in fact voted, a permanent moratorium. As the full
152	00:11:01.980	00:11:05.740	House has voted. They say that after June '85, when
153	00:11:05.750	00:11:08.920	access charges could go in place again, access charges may
154	00:11:08.930	00:11:10.850	well be in place again because there won't be the
155	00:11:10.860	00:11:13.500	election-year political pressure that was put on the FCC this
156	00:11:13.510	00:11:17.340	year. Since they are so unpopular with so many people,
157	00:11:17.350	00:11:20.340	is it likely that instead of just an interim solution,
158	00:11:20.350	00:11:23.650	this delay could become permanent and we'll never see access
159	00:11:23.660	00:11:26.270	charges? Well, that gets to the political question of what
160	00:11:26.280	00:11:27.880	Congress is going to do, and that is a very
161	00:11:27.890	00:11:31.210	difficult one to call right now. Thirty-two senators wrote to
162	00:11:31.220	00:11:34.420	the FCC just yesterday to ask them to do essentially
163	00:11:34.430	00:11:36.610	what they did today. That's a significant part of the
164	00:11:36.620	00:11:40.520	United States Senate. There's another 60-some-odd members who didn't express
165	00:11:40.530	00:11:43.130	their views, and there is a bill from Senator Packwood
166	00:11:43.140	00:11:45.430	which he intends to press for which would put on
167	00:11:45.440	00:11:50.210	a moratorium. We'll have to see. Political pressures in election
168	00:11:50.220	00:11:53.880	years, particularly on pocketbook issues, play funny twists, and they
169	00:11:53.890	00:11:55.450	should on this one too, I would think. So the
170	00:11:55.460	00:11:59.110	access charges could come back in the summer of 1985
171	00:11:59.120	00:12:01.400	or they could go away forever, we just don't know
172	00:12:01.410	00:12:03.720	yet. We don't know yet. Now, on the other decision
173	00:12:03.730	00:12:06.580	that was announced today, would you explain it to me?
174	00:12:06.590	00:12:12.050	As I understand it, AT&T's long distance competitors, like MCI,
175	00:12:12.060	00:12:15.570	had the rates they will have to pay for long
176	00:12:15.580	00:12:18.960	distance to the local companies to hook in for long
177	00:12:18.970	00:12:21.850	distance--were much lower than was expected. Now, can you
178	00:12:21.860	00:12:24.290	tell us the figures and what it means? Well, what
179	00:12:24.300	00:12:27.130	it means, according to the long distance industry, the competitive
180	00:12:27.140	00:12:29.900	long distance industry, that is, is that that's a much
181	00:12:29.910	00:12:32.730	more competitive business under this decision than under the previous
182	00:12:32.740	00:12:36.920	decision. They'll pay about half of what AT&T pays for
183	00:12:36.930	00:12:40.200	hookups into the local phone system now. Before, under the
184	00:12:40.210	00:12:42.830	previous decision they were paying considerably more than that, about
185	00:12:42.840	00:12:46.510	50% more than that. So if AT&T pays nine cents,
186	00:12:46.520	00:12:48.650	say, which is roughly what the figure is, to hook
187	00:12:48.660	00:12:52.370	into a local line now, MCI will pay four-some cents
188	00:12:52.380	00:12:55.050	to do the same thing. And it's their contention that
189	00:12:55.060	00:12:57.630	they shouldn't pay the same amount as AT&T as long
190	00:12:57.640	00:13:00.110	as they don't have the same kind of easy access
191	00:13:00.120	00:13:03.010	to consumers that AT&T has. If you want to use
192	00:13:03.020	00:13:05.820	MCI or Sprint or Allnet or a host of other
193	00:13:05.830	00:13:07.760	services that are out there, you have to punch a
194	00:13:07.770	00:13:10.430	lot of buttons, dial into the service, punch in your
195	00:13:10.440	00:13:14.460	personal billing code. It's a slightly more complicated procedure. And
196	00:13:14.470	00:13:17.600	the long distance competitors argue that until they have the
197	00:13:17.610	00:13:22.050	same kind of simple pushbutton, one-button access that the AT&T
198	00:13:22.060	00:13:25.450	company has, they shouldn't pay the same rates. And, briefly,
199	00:13:25.460	00:13:29.860	is the long-term effect of that through more competition to
200	00:13:29.870	00:13:32.570	bring down long distance phone rates, do you think? Well,
201	00:13:32.580	00:13:35.150	certainly for the people around the country who have access
202	00:13:35.160	00:13:38.420	to a long distance service, a competitive one, one competitive
203	00:13:38.430	00:13:41.270	with AT&T, it ensures that they'll keep the same kind
204	00:13:41.280	00:13:44.280	of low rates they have. For AT&T users or for
205	00:13:44.290	00:13:47.010	people who need AT&T for business services or for other
206	00:13:47.020	00:13:49.750	things, it probably suggests that they won't get the same
207	00:13:49.760	00:13:52.680	kind of cut AT&T was planning on. Well, Mr. Brown,
208	00:13:52.690	00:13:56.750	thank you. Judy? More good news about the economy today
209	00:13:56.760	00:14:00.220	on several fronts. The government said that Americans' personal income
210	00:14:00.230	00:14:05.620	was up 6.3% last year, the best showing since 1977.
211	00:14:05.630	00:14:09.860	Economists attributed the relatively healthy increase to last summer's income
212	00:14:09.870	00:14:14.270	tax cuts, more people finding work and lower inflation. Most
213	00:14:14.280	00:14:18.820	predicted personal income would not grow as much in 1984.
214	00:14:18.830	00:14:21.450	At the White House, however, a spokesman said the prospects
215	00:14:21.460	00:14:25.270	for a sustained economic recovery are very good. In another
216	00:14:25.280	00:14:28.800	measure of the recovery, the government also reported personal consumption
217	00:14:28.810	00:14:33.170	spending rose 8.4% last year, a little better than the
218	00:14:33.180	00:14:36.670	year before. That was mostly attributed to a sharp drop
219	00:14:36.680	00:14:40.100	in the rate of savings. In addition, first-time claims for
220	00:14:40.110	00:14:44.500	unemployment benefits hit their lowest point in four-and-a-half years in
221	00:14:44.510	00:14:48.720	the first week in January. President Reagan and his speechwriters
222	00:14:48.730	00:14:51.800	will use all that good economic news and more in
223	00:14:51.810	00:14:54.580	preparing his State of the Union address for next week,
224	00:14:54.590	00:14:57.310	a speech that reportedly will paint a rosy picture of
225	00:14:57.320	00:15:00.950	the nation's health. But today in Washington the National Urban
226	00:15:00.960	00:15:04.500	League, in its annual "State of Black America," offered a
227	00:15:04.510	00:15:09.310	very different portrayal of the economic conditions facing American blacks.
228	00:15:09.320	00:15:14.340	The report included chapters on such subjects as unemployment, education
229	00:15:14.350	00:15:18.540	and voter registration, and it cited numerous bleak statistics: an
230	00:15:18.550	00:15:22.400	18% unemployment rate for blacks, and the fact that more
231	00:15:22.410	00:15:26.420	than 50% of all black children live in families below
232	00:15:26.430	00:15:30.330	the poverty line. In releasing the report, Urban League president
233	00:15:30.340	00:15:34.020	John Jacob said simply, "The state of black America is
234	00:15:34.030	00:15:36.540	a disaster." Mr. Jacob is with is with us here
235	00:15:36.550	00:15:41.920	tonight to elaborate. Mr. Jacob, is the situation facing American
236	00:15:41.930	00:15:45.280	blacks as serious as what you have said? We believe
237	00:15:45.290	00:15:49.460	that all the evidence points in that direction. Clearly, as
238	00:15:49.470	00:15:52.720	the nation is moving toward an economic recovery, as unemployment
239	00:15:52.730	00:15:57.020	is going down around the nation somewhere around 8.1, 8.2%,
240	00:15:57.030	00:16:02.080	unemployment for blacks is at 18%; teenage unemployment is at
241	00:16:02.090	00:16:06.620	49%; a third of black people are living in poverty.
242	00:16:06.630	00:16:10.930	Therefore, even as the nation is going through a spirited
243	00:16:10.940	00:16:13.970	recovery, it is not trickling down to black America, and
244	00:16:13.980	00:16:16.480	black America is suffering and in desperate straits. Well, why
245	00:16:16.490	00:16:19.510	is that? Why is, despite the fact that we're seeing
246	00:16:19.520	00:16:22.320	all these improvements you mentioned in inflation and unemployment, that
247	00:16:22.330	00:16:24.720	blacks aren't able to share in the goodies? Well, I
248	00:16:24.730	00:16:26.350	think there are a number of factors, one of which
249	00:16:26.360	00:16:29.570	is that blacks have traditionally been in those jobs where
250	00:16:29.580	00:16:34.200	the industries are hemorrhaging--steel, rubber, auto--and many of
251	00:16:34.210	00:16:37.330	those jobs, even as they go through recovery will never
252	00:16:37.340	00:16:39.700	replace many of the jobs that they lost during the
253	00:16:39.710	00:16:42.150	recession. And so we paid a dear price for that.
254	00:16:42.160	00:16:45.320	Secondly I think blacks are confronted with the notion that
255	00:16:45.330	00:16:47.200	they were the last hired and first fired as a
256	00:16:47.210	00:16:50.050	result of the deep recession that we found ourselves in,
257	00:16:50.060	00:16:53.060	and therefore we are affected by all of that that
258	00:16:53.070	00:16:56.100	is happening. But I think thirdly, as you will note
259	00:16:56.110	00:16:59.330	when you go through this paper, that there is a
260	00:16:59.340	00:17:02.620	high-tech revolution that has taken place in the country, and
261	00:17:02.630	00:17:05.290	blacks are in a mismatch with that revolution. We either
262	00:17:05.300	00:17:08.160	live in the wrong place where high tech is being
263	00:17:08.170	00:17:12.790	suburbanized. We picked up degrees in education and social science
264	00:17:12.800	00:17:16.220	when high tech calls for another whole set of skills.
265	00:17:16.230	00:17:19.810	We are dealing with a phenomenon that suggests that there
266	00:17:19.820	00:17:21.150	are going to be a lot of jobs in the
267	00:17:21.160	00:17:23.850	high-tech area, and they're simple not coming about. Blacks only
268	00:17:23.860	00:17:27.400	occupy one out of every 20 high-tech jobs. And therefore
269	00:17:27.410	00:17:30.810	we have simply, for some reason, been faced with a
270	00:17:30.820	00:17:34.500	condition that has placed us in opposition to that particular
271	00:17:34.510	00:17:37.390	trend. Who's to blame for this? Well, I think there
272	00:17:37.400	00:17:40.720	are a number of places to place blame, one of
273	00:17:40.730	00:17:44.810	which is clearly that our society has never admitted that
274	00:17:44.820	00:17:47.050	it has to make a concerted effort for inclusion of
275	00:17:47.060	00:17:50.330	black people. The whole notion about affirmative action was designed
276	00:17:50.340	00:17:55.360	to do that. The whole notion about the public-service sector
277	00:17:55.370	00:17:59.330	accommodating a large sector of the black middle class allowed
278	00:17:59.340	00:18:02.740	for an upward mobility of blacks, and then the decimation
279	00:18:02.750	00:18:06.010	of the public-service arena calls for a broadening of the
280	00:18:06.020	00:18:08.270	gap between black America and white America. When you blame
281	00:18:08.280	00:18:10.450	it on society, you're not saying it's the fault of
282	00:18:10.460	00:18:12.780	the Republicans or the Democrats or Ronald Reagan or anyone
283	00:18:12.790	00:18:15.910	else; you're just saying white America? Well, I'm just saying
284	00:18:15.920	00:18:19.670	there are a set of economic circumstances that have not
285	00:18:19.680	00:18:22.420	worked to the advantage of black people, and that black
286	00:18:22.430	00:18:25.730	people have not been included in all of the developments
287	00:18:25.740	00:18:28.330	that have taken place. I am blaming on the administration,
288	00:18:28.340	00:18:32.590	however, in the exacerbation of the problem. When in fact
289	00:18:32.600	00:18:36.250	you look at where black people were three years ago,
290	00:18:36.260	00:18:40.900	four years ago, with the new administration and the reduction
291	00:18:40.910	00:18:44.730	or elimination of many of the vital programs that service
292	00:18:44.740	00:18:48.970	black people, that service poor people, where blacks were disproportionately
293	00:18:48.980	00:18:52.470	placed, conditions have, as a result of that, grown worse
294	00:18:52.480	00:18:54.660	for black America. What does the report say should be
295	00:18:54.670	00:18:57.130	done to remedy this? Well, we make a number of
296	00:18:57.140	00:19:00.050	proposals, one of which is that we believe that the
297	00:19:00.060	00:19:04.260	first priority item for black America must be jobs. Therefore
298	00:19:04.270	00:19:08.550	there must be a multidimensional strategy to provide work and
299	00:19:08.560	00:19:11.820	training opportunities for black people. That is not going to
300	00:19:11.830	00:19:14.510	be done with a single-dimensional program, and so we call
301	00:19:14.520	00:19:16.950	for public works, we call for public service, we call
302	00:19:16.960	00:19:20.050	for rewarding the private sector for hiring the long-term unemployed,
303	00:19:20.060	00:19:22.570	in training the long-term unemployed, and we call for an
304	00:19:22.580	00:19:27.400	industrial policy commitment that says that we will retrain those
305	00:19:27.410	00:19:30.430	people that are being displaced out of the smokestack industries.
306	00:19:30.440	00:19:31.960	And who's going to pay for all those jobs and
307	00:19:31.970	00:19:34.770	all that retraining? Well, I think what we ought to
308	00:19:34.780	00:19:37.780	ask is who's paying for all the high unemployment, because
309	00:19:37.790	00:19:40.220	if you look at the numbers today, all economists will
310	00:19:40.230	00:19:43.900	agree that for every point of unemployment above 4%, it
311	00:19:43.910	00:19:47.790	costs this country, either in lost taxes or in supporting
312	00:19:47.800	00:19:51.890	higher unemployment, from $20 billion to $30 billion per point.
313	00:19:51.900	00:19:55.130	So even with 8% unemployment, on the low side we're
314	00:19:55.140	00:19:58.680	talking about $80 billion to support unemployment, and on the
315	00:19:58.690	00:20:01.890	high side we're talking about $120 billion. I submit to
316	00:20:01.900	00:20:04.000	you there ought to be more creative use of those
317	00:20:04.010	00:20:06.090	dollars in order to get people working and training. But
318	00:20:06.100	00:20:08.400	Mr. Jacob, you know what the political climate is in
319	00:20:08.410	00:20:11.420	this country with Ronald Reagan maintaining pretty high ratings in
320	00:20:11.430	00:20:13.440	the public opinion polls right now, and we know what
321	00:20:13.450	00:20:16.710	his philosophy is. What do you think the chances are
322	00:20:16.720	00:20:19.180	realistically that that sort of program would ever pass the
323	00:20:19.190	00:20:22.000	Congress? Well, I think the chances are that the black
324	00:20:22.010	00:20:24.450	vote is going to be decisive in 1984, and is
325	00:20:24.460	00:20:26.690	going to be decisive not only in the presidential election
326	00:20:26.700	00:20:29.410	but in senatorial elections. And I submit to you that
327	00:20:29.420	00:20:33.010	those who are serious about attracting the black vote will
328	00:20:33.020	00:20:35.220	have to address these problems that are critical to black
329	00:20:35.230	00:20:37.570	America. What do you mean by that? I mean that
330	00:20:37.580	00:20:39.940	they will have to come forth with an agenda that
331	00:20:39.950	00:20:43.460	deals specifically with the interests and needs of black America
332	00:20:43.470	00:20:46.430	if in fact they expect to get the black vote.
333	00:20:46.440	00:20:49.930	But Ronald Reagan, one would presume, doesn't feel that he
334	00:20:49.940	00:20:52.050	needs the black vote, or very much of the black
335	00:20:52.060	00:20:54.410	vote, in order to win again. Well, I would hope
336	00:20:54.420	00:20:56.760	that Mr. Reagan would reassess that because I think the
337	00:20:56.770	00:20:59.910	black vote is going to be very decisive, particularly in
338	00:20:59.920	00:21:03.270	determining the electoral college votes. Our report speaks to where
339	00:21:03.280	00:21:08.250	those black voters are concentrated. They are concentrated in the
340	00:21:08.260	00:21:10.850	large cities and the large states where the electoral college
341	00:21:10.860	00:21:13.010	votes must come from. And so I would say that
342	00:21:13.020	00:21:15.950	Mr. Reagan must reassess if in fact he hoped to
343	00:21:15.960	00:21:18.950	remain at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. So you haven't given up
344	00:21:18.960	00:21:21.440	on Ronald Reagan; you're saying you hope to change his
345	00:21:21.450	00:21:23.830	mind, is that right? Well, no, what I'm saying is
346	00:21:23.840	00:21:27.190	that I hope Mr. Reagan understands the political realities that
347	00:21:27.200	00:21:29.670	all the other candidates must come to grips with, and
348	00:21:29.680	00:21:32.780	that in 1984 it is our contention that the black
349	00:21:32.790	00:21:34.700	vote is going to play a major role in who
350	00:21:34.710	00:21:37.530	occupies the White House. All right, thank you very much,
351	00:21:37.540	00:21:40.790	John Jacob, for being with us. Thank you. Robin? The
352	00:21:40.800	00:21:44.260	United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization said today that nearly
353	00:21:44.270	00:21:47.530	half the countries in Africa are threatened by massive hunger
354	00:21:47.540	00:21:51.350	and starvation this year. The FAO said a significant part
355	00:21:51.360	00:21:55.170	of the 150 million people living in 24 countries in
356	00:21:55.180	00:21:59.530	East, West and Southern Africa faced grave food shortages. The
357	00:21:59.540	00:22:04.530	causes were bushfires, livestock diseases, pests and civil disturbances, but
358	00:22:04.540	00:22:07.470	the greatest was drought, considered the worst in a century
359	00:22:07.480	00:22:11.550	in some areas. The U.N. agency said that 5.3 million
360	00:22:11.560	00:22:16.760	tons of grains were needed for 1983-1984, of which 3.7
361	00:22:16.770	00:22:21.280	million tons had already been secured. Meanwhile in Washington, Senator
362	00:22:21.290	00:22:24.660	John Danforth reported on his own personal observation of the
363	00:22:24.670	00:22:28.180	hunger problem in Africa. The Missouri Republican was asked by
364	00:22:28.190	00:22:31.830	Majority Leader Howard Baker to make a personal inspection trip.
365	00:22:31.840	00:22:35.650	The results, including Senator Danforth's own photographs, were presented to
366	00:22:35.660	00:22:38.910	President Reagan yesterday and made public at a news conference
367	00:22:38.920	00:22:46.910	today. Africa now is the number one hunger problem in
368	00:22:46.920	00:22:51.740	the world. This mother could not give milk to the
369	00:22:51.750	00:22:56.630	child. She was very hungry herself, and, as often true
370	00:22:56.640	00:23:00.800	with hungry mothers, they cannot produce sufficient milk for the
371	00:23:00.810	00:23:06.590	child, and you see the result. And all ages, of
372	00:23:06.600	00:23:13.370	course, affected. The legs on that boy I think are
373	00:23:13.380	00:23:18.700	illustrative. The people in one of the villages had had
374	00:23:18.710	00:23:24.790	no food since November, and their diet consisted of leaves
375	00:23:24.800	00:23:30.430	from trees, roots, and cashew nuts. And one of the
376	00:23:30.440	00:23:34.670	things that I talked to the President about yesterday is
377	00:23:34.680	00:23:38.660	the immediate need in Mozambique not only to make sure
378	00:23:38.670	00:23:42.600	food is available--I think more important than anything else
379	00:23:42.610	00:23:48.480	is to designate some organization, such as CARE or some
380	00:23:48.490	00:23:52.670	other organization, to actually be present and to be responsible
381	00:23:52.680	00:23:56.060	for the delivery of the food and the distribution of
382	00:23:56.070	00:23:59.450	the food. I think if we're going to have any
383	00:23:59.460	00:24:05.590	type of possible--any sort of possibility of relative independence
384	00:24:05.600	00:24:07.240	for that part of the world, there is going to
385	00:24:07.250	00:24:10.280	have to be development assistance, again targeted to those countries
386	00:24:10.290	00:24:13.930	where it's going to do some good. The United States
387	00:24:13.940	00:24:17.700	is now spending about $300 million a year in emergency
388	00:24:17.710	00:24:21.410	food aid for Africa. Senator Danforth estimates that an additional
389	00:24:21.420	00:24:26.080	$200 million in development assistance is needed. We'll be back
390	00:24:26.090	00:25:32.550	in a moment. In Casablanca, the Islamic Conference Organization decided
391	00:25:32.560	00:25:36.260	tonight to readmit Egypt to membership five years after Egypt
392	00:25:36.270	00:25:39.380	was suspended for signing a peace treaty with Israel. The
393	00:25:39.390	00:25:43.430	Egyptians have indicated they're interested in rejoining the 45-nation body,
394	00:25:43.440	00:25:46.090	but have declared they would not submit to any conditions,
395	00:25:46.100	00:25:50.880	such as repudiating the Israeli-Egyptian treaty. In Lebanon, the guns
396	00:25:50.890	00:25:54.070	around Beirut were silent for a day while both Moslems
397	00:25:54.080	00:25:57.250	and Christians closed their classrooms in mourning for the president
398	00:25:57.260	00:26:00.710	of the American University, who was killed yesterday. But in
399	00:26:00.720	00:26:03.540	a mountain area near the northern city of Tripoli, four
400	00:26:03.550	00:26:06.310	people were killed and 14 wounded in a fight between
401	00:26:06.320	00:26:10.380	two rival factions of pro-Syrian Moslems. And in the southern
402	00:26:10.390	00:26:14.190	city of Sidon, gunmen attacked an Israeli patrol, touching off
403	00:26:14.200	00:26:16.920	a 30-minute firefight that closed the port and the business
404	00:26:16.930	00:26:20.390	area for the third day in a row. In Washington,
405	00:26:20.400	00:26:24.190	the State Department announced a relaxation of American economic sanctions
406	00:26:24.200	00:26:27.820	against Poland. By order of President Reagan, the Polish national
407	00:26:27.830	00:26:30.880	airline will be allowed to land its planes on charter
408	00:26:30.890	00:26:33.800	flights to the United States and Polish vessels will be
409	00:26:33.810	00:26:37.040	allowed to fish in American waters. And in Rome, Pope
410	00:26:37.050	00:26:40.450	John Paul has been discussing the possibility of opening diplomatic
411	00:26:40.460	00:26:44.050	relations between the Vatican and the Communist government of Poland,
412	00:26:44.060	00:26:47.410	perhaps later this year. Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the head of
413	00:26:47.420	00:26:50.460	the Polish Catholic Church, told reporters about it today as
414	00:26:50.470	00:26:54.920	he left Rome after a four-day visit. Judy? Argentina's new
415	00:26:54.930	00:26:59.970	government, headed by democratically elected President Raul Alfonsin, announced today
416	00:26:59.980	00:27:03.810	that it was ending all assistance to counterrevolutionary forces in
417	00:27:03.820	00:27:08.360	Central America. Those include the so-called contras the United States
418	00:27:08.370	00:27:11.340	is backing in their struggle against the Marxist government in
419	00:27:11.350	00:27:16.200	Nicaragua. Alfonsin said he was aligning Argentina with Mexico and
420	00:27:16.210	00:27:20.080	other Latin countries which are seeking negotiated settlements to end
421	00:27:20.090	00:27:23.540	the disputes there. Meanwhile, there has been more fighting in
422	00:27:23.550	00:27:27.210	El Salvador, where government troops are trying to prevent leftist
423	00:27:27.220	00:27:31.010	guerrillas from destroying the last remaining bridge over a major
424	00:27:31.020	00:27:35.170	waterway. The Lempa River divides the eastern third of El
425	00:27:35.180	00:27:38.520	Salvador from the rest of the country. Since September the
426	00:27:38.530	00:27:42.040	rebels have made significant gains toward their goal of taking
427	00:27:42.050	00:27:44.940	over the area east of the river and declaring it
428	00:27:44.950	00:27:48.610	a liberated zone. Chirilagua is a small town in the
429	00:27:48.620	00:27:54.040	eastern third, located behind rebel lines. Our special correspondent, Charles
430	00:27:54.050	00:27:57.840	Krause, recently spent five days there and discovered that even
431	00:27:57.850	00:28:00.900	though the town is controlled by guerrillas, there is still
432	00:28:00.910	00:28:06.240	an important American presence there. Chirilagua fell to the guerrillas
433	00:28:06.250	00:28:10.680	last September 25th. Every two or three days, patrols from
434	00:28:10.690	00:28:15.110	nearby guerrilla bases entered Chirilagua to make their presence felt,
435	00:28:15.120	00:28:18.740	but otherwise life here hasn't changed very much since the
436	00:28:18.750	00:28:23.680	guerrillas took control. Buses still connect Chirilagua with other parts
437	00:28:23.690	00:28:28.450	of El Salvador. The post office still functions. And despite
438	00:28:28.460	00:28:32.160	their avowed Marxism, the guerrillas have made no attempt to
439	00:28:32.170	00:28:44.920	disrupt Chirilagua's religious life. On Sundays there's been no change
440	00:28:44.930	00:28:49.170	at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. Mass is still celebrated,
441	00:28:49.180	00:28:53.730	very much as usual. What is unusual is that for
442	00:28:53.740	00:28:57.770	many years the Chirilagua parish has been staffed by American
443	00:28:57.780	00:29:05.240	missionaries from Cleveland, Ohio. That hasn't changed either. Well, since
444	00:29:05.250	00:29:11.350	the end of September the guerrillas have nominal control over
445	00:29:11.360	00:29:15.790	the town. They haven't hindered us in any way. We're
446	00:29:15.800	00:29:23.320	cautious. You know, we can't accept necessarily their beliefs or
447	00:29:23.330	00:29:26.820	their philosophical background they're coming from--it's not the same
448	00:29:26.830	00:29:35.620	as ours--and it's a delicate and complicated situation. Father
449	00:29:35.630	00:29:40.270	John Loya is one of four American missionaries in Chirilagua.
450	00:29:40.280	00:29:45.210	He, Father David Fallon, Sisters Therese Osborne and Maria Berlich,
451	00:29:45.220	00:29:48.350	are believed to be the only American priests and nuns
452	00:29:48.360	00:29:52.980	living and working behind guerrilla lines in El Salvador. But
453	00:29:52.990	00:29:56.750	unlike some other foreign priests who've embraced the guerrillas, these
454	00:29:56.760	00:30:01.320	Americans are not radicals or political activists. It's a really
455	00:30:01.330	00:30:04.560	tense situation because, coming from the United States where we
456	00:30:04.570	00:30:09.260	have a tradition of freedom of speech, it is very
457	00:30:09.270	00:30:11.770	hard to adjust to a situation in which you don't
458	00:30:11.780	00:30:15.510	feel that same liberty. Sister Therese told us that she
459	00:30:15.520	00:30:18.930	and her colleagues from Cleveland view their mission as ministering
460	00:30:18.940	00:30:22.430	to the needs of the people of Chirilagua, regardless of
461	00:30:22.440	00:30:26.450	which side has political control of the town and surrounding
462	00:30:26.460	00:30:32.000	area. We're foreign missionaries, and I think that we are
463	00:30:32.010	00:30:36.130	fulfilling a role right now in the country, helping people,
464	00:30:36.140	00:30:39.780	helping the Christian communities. And we want to be able
465	00:30:39.790	00:30:43.290	to remain in this area. Father David has been in
466	00:30:43.300	00:30:46.810	El Salvador for six years. He's the senior member of
467	00:30:46.820	00:30:52.500	the Cleveland mission and pastor of the Chirilagua church. Before
468	00:30:52.510	00:30:54.760	we came here, there was no priest; and if we
469	00:30:54.770	00:30:57.890	weren't here, there wouldn't be any priests or sisters, so
470	00:30:57.900	00:31:02.420	that our work is very extensive. A lot of the
471	00:31:02.430	00:31:09.810	work is sacramental work, that is, celebrating the Mass and
472	00:31:09.820	00:31:14.880	baptism and weddings, other sacraments. But despite that, I like
473	00:31:14.890	00:31:18.920	to think that the focus we have is to encourage
474	00:31:18.930	00:31:23.140	and train lay leadership, knowing that we can be there,
475	00:31:23.150	00:31:25.980	seldom be there--somebody has to do most of the
476	00:31:25.990	00:31:29.890	work of evangelizing, of bringing the message of Christ to
477	00:31:29.900	00:31:34.320	others. In addition to their work in the town of
478	00:31:34.330	00:31:38.420	Chirilagua, the priests celebrate Mass at least once a month
479	00:31:38.430	00:31:43.220	in about 25 small villages, villages like El Cucol. The
480	00:31:43.230	00:31:46.430	American missionaries work in an area of about 100 square
481	00:31:46.440	00:31:49.780	miles, all of it now at least nominally controlled by
482	00:31:49.790	00:31:53.170	the guerrillas. One of the communities we visit is named
483	00:31:53.180	00:31:58.190	Guadalupe. We usually only go there once a month, but
484	00:31:58.200	00:32:00.900	I was visiting there and I knew this woman was
485	00:32:00.910	00:32:05.480	ill; I'd visited her before in a community called La
486	00:32:05.490	00:32:08.720	Nina Chinita, it means like the child--it's term of
487	00:32:08.730	00:32:13.150	endearment; her name is really Cypriana. She's been living there
488	00:32:13.160	00:32:17.580	for about, oh, better part of a year. And so
489	00:32:17.590	00:32:19.410	I decided to bring her Communion, because I knew that
490	00:32:19.420	00:32:23.270	she wanted Communion. And she was just overjoyed to have
491	00:32:23.280	00:32:27.500	a visit. Simple faith. She knows she's ill, she doesn't
492	00:32:27.510	00:32:29.760	want to go to a hospital; she wants to die
493	00:32:29.770	00:32:34.400	at home. One of the things that struck me quite
494	00:32:34.410	00:32:38.620	quickly was the way people are very close to the
495	00:32:38.630	00:32:42.860	birth and death. People are born in their homes, not
496	00:32:42.870	00:32:45.200	in hospitals, in the rural areas. They die in their
497	00:32:45.210	00:32:49.350	homes. They prepare the body. On more than one occasion
498	00:32:49.360	00:32:54.900	I have been celebrating a Mass or wedding, and because
499	00:32:54.910	00:32:57.260	at that same time someone died, they brought the body
500	00:32:57.270	00:32:59.460	in. And we had a wedding and a funeral at
501	00:32:59.470	00:33:02.480	the same time, and the people were not upset in
502	00:33:02.490	00:33:08.210	the least. They're just not hidden from those realities. Outsiders
503	00:33:08.220	00:33:13.060	are often shocked by how primitive conditions are. Sister Maria
504	00:33:13.070	00:33:15.810	told us that she too was shocked when she first
505	00:33:15.820	00:33:20.290	came to Chirilagua three years ago. The actual reality of
506	00:33:20.300	00:33:24.640	Chirilagua was much different than just seeing it in the
507	00:33:24.650	00:33:29.600	pictures and in the slides, because the poverty of some
508	00:33:29.610	00:33:32.760	of the places is really striking. I just couldn't believe
509	00:33:32.770	00:33:38.000	that people really did live in little stick huts. Infant
510	00:33:38.010	00:33:43.490	mortality is high. Life expectancy for adults is low. At
511	00:33:43.500	00:33:47.120	least once a week Sister Therese travels to outlying villages
512	00:33:47.130	00:33:50.850	in the parish, often by horseback to work with volunteer
513	00:33:50.860	00:33:55.480	health teams. It's not strictly religious work. But it is
514	00:33:55.490	00:33:58.100	very much a part of what the Cleveland mission is
515	00:33:58.110	00:34:02.660	all about. Each local community has three to seven team
516	00:34:02.670	00:34:06.840	members who will learn about certain health themes and then
517	00:34:06.850	00:34:09.900	present them to their neighbors. The health needs are so
518	00:34:09.910	00:34:12.240	great that if we were to work on the curative
519	00:34:12.250	00:34:17.450	aspect, giving shots or dispensing medicines, we wouldn't even begin
520	00:34:17.460	00:34:20.960	to scratch the surface. So we're trying to work in
521	00:34:20.970	00:34:27.950	the preventive angle, hoping to prevent mostly infant deaths. If
522	00:34:27.960	00:34:31.570	children do survive, education is a luxury many of their
523	00:34:31.580	00:34:35.140	parents cannot afford. By the age of eight or nine,
524	00:34:35.150	00:34:39.220	many children in El Salvador, especially in rural areas, must
525	00:34:39.230	00:34:44.340	work. Sister Maria has taught reading skills to illiterate adults,
526	00:34:44.350	00:34:47.090	but most of her work is with children, who learn
527	00:34:47.100	00:34:50.880	more than just religion in her classes. It's unrealistic to
528	00:34:50.890	00:34:53.700	expect that they'll ever be able to reach any high
529	00:34:53.710	00:34:57.290	formal level of education. At least they will have had
530	00:34:57.300	00:35:01.310	the dignity of saying, "Once I did go to school,
531	00:35:01.320	00:35:05.240	and I did learn something." What even the best-educated Salvadorans
532	00:35:05.250	00:35:08.500	have not learned is how to resolve their economic and
533	00:35:08.510	00:35:13.740	political differences. When Chirilagua fell last fall, the guerrillas explained
534	00:35:13.750	00:35:17.940	their political program and promised not to invite an army
535	00:35:17.950	00:35:22.860	attack by occupying the town full time. About a thousand
536	00:35:22.870	00:35:28.260	government supporters fled, fearing the guerrillas would confiscate private property
537	00:35:28.270	00:35:32.560	and kill those identified with the government. The situation here
538	00:35:32.570	00:35:36.560	could have been most difficult and dangerous for Fathers David
539	00:35:36.570	00:35:40.960	and John, Sisters Therese and Maria. They are, after all,
540	00:35:40.970	00:35:46.330	Catholic missionaries living in a town controlled by Marxist revolutionaries,
541	00:35:46.340	00:35:50.340	and Americans working in an area dominated by guerrillas who
542	00:35:50.350	00:35:54.730	consider the United States their principal enemy. We asked them
543	00:35:54.740	00:35:58.480	if they weren't afraid to remain here, knowing the guerrillas
544	00:35:58.490	00:36:01.890	could one day turn on them, or the government could
545	00:36:01.900	00:36:05.910	accuse them of being leftist sympathizers if the army ever
546	00:36:05.920	00:36:12.100	regains control of Chirilagua. There's always a certain amount of
547	00:36:12.110	00:36:17.070	uncertainty associated with a situation like this of conflict--what's
548	00:36:17.080	00:36:19.420	going to happen next? We feel it, the people feel
549	00:36:19.430	00:36:24.590	it. I would think that we are being treated or
550	00:36:24.600	00:36:29.270	approached as individuals. The boys will condemn the Yankees and
551	00:36:29.280	00:36:34.440	the imperialism and everything like that, but they've met four
552	00:36:34.450	00:36:41.500	of us here, and have respected us in that regard.
553	00:36:41.510	00:36:44.150	Human right, or human value, or whatever values they're working
554	00:36:44.160	00:36:47.700	with. People are very, very nervous. Many of them are
555	00:36:47.710	00:36:52.210	suffering from nervous disorders now with the constant tension. One
556	00:36:52.220	00:36:55.770	side may be in charge today, and another side may
557	00:36:55.780	00:36:58.540	be in charge tomorrow. And as long as there are
558	00:36:58.550	00:37:01.960	two different sides, maybe there isn't any problem right now,
559	00:37:01.970	00:37:04.360	but if there's a battle--they call it in Spanish
560	00:37:04.370	00:37:08.060	an enfrentamiento--people are going to be hurt and people
561	00:37:08.070	00:37:09.880	are going to be killed, and I guess that's their
562	00:37:09.890	00:37:14.960	constant fear. I'm not afraid. But I'm not afraid anywhere.
563	00:37:14.970	00:37:17.560	I'm not afraid in Cleveland, where I come from. And
564	00:37:17.570	00:37:19.770	anything could have happened to me where I used to
565	00:37:19.780	00:37:22.350	live in Cleveland, the same as anything can happen to
566	00:37:22.360	00:37:27.840	me here. So I think that's where my idea of
567	00:37:27.850	00:37:30.340	what faith and who God is comes in. We can
568	00:37:30.350	00:37:32.400	travel a road of faith or we can travel a
569	00:37:32.410	00:37:38.180	road of fear. And as a priest, following the example
570	00:37:38.190	00:37:41.110	of our Lord, a great deal of my job or
571	00:37:41.120	00:37:45.130	my vocation is to help people make the decision: what's
572	00:37:45.140	00:37:51.010	the basic denominator that we're living our lives by? Is
573	00:37:51.020	00:37:53.450	it by faith or is it by fear? This is
574	00:37:53.460	00:38:02.880	one way of spreading or teaching the Gospel. You may
575	00:38:02.890	00:38:06.690	remember that in 1980 four American churchwomen were killed in
576	00:38:06.700	00:38:10.420	El Salvador. Their families are reportedly angry at a State
577	00:38:10.430	00:38:13.810	Department decision this week not to release a report on
578	00:38:13.820	00:38:17.190	the failure of the Salvadoran government to bring to trial
579	00:38:17.200	00:38:20.950	five soldiers accused of murdering the Americans. Two of the
580	00:38:20.960	00:38:24.030	women were from Cleveland, members of the same team of
581	00:38:24.040	00:38:57.430	missionaries working in Chirilagua. We'll be back in a moment.
582	00:38:57.440	00:39:00.460	In New York, a federal appeals court tonight turned down
583	00:39:00.470	00:39:04.230	a last-minute effort by former New Jersey Senator Harrison Williams
584	00:39:04.240	00:39:07.710	to delay beginning his prison sentence for bribery in the
585	00:39:07.720	00:39:12.000	Abscam investigation. In an unusual hearing after the usual court
586	00:39:12.010	00:39:15.760	hours, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals denied a request
587	00:39:15.770	00:39:19.510	for delay so Williams could file another appeal against his
588	00:39:19.520	00:39:23.270	conviction. That left Williams under orders by the trial judge
589	00:39:23.280	00:39:26.890	to report to the federal prison in Allenwood, Pennyslvania, by
590	00:39:26.900	00:39:31.670	midnight tonight to begin his three-year sentence. The medical examiner
591	00:39:31.680	00:39:35.190	in San Antonio, Texas, ruled today that Major General Robert
592	00:39:35.200	00:39:38.350	Owenby, the Army reservist who was found hanged in a
593	00:39:38.360	00:39:42.560	stairwell, committed suicide. When the general's body was found eight
594	00:39:42.570	00:39:45.570	days ago, his hands were bound behind his back and
595	00:39:45.580	00:39:47.900	there was a note pinned to his clothes saying he
596	00:39:47.910	00:39:51.450	had been executed. The medical examiner said today that tests
597	00:39:51.460	00:39:54.680	made by his office and the FBI led to the
598	00:39:54.690	00:39:57.540	conclusion that the general wrote the note himself as a
599	00:39:57.550	00:40:01.190	deception. The examiner also said that Owenby was deeply in
600	00:40:01.200	00:40:06.190	debt. Robin? Now, stories from our medical beat. First, new
601	00:40:06.200	00:40:10.080	evidence was reported today linking damage to unborn babies with
602	00:40:10.090	00:40:13.740	mothers who smoke cigarettes during pregnancy. A study made at
603	00:40:13.750	00:40:17.280	Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore showed that young rats whose
604	00:40:17.290	00:40:20.680	mothers were exposed to moderate amounts of carbon monoxide during
605	00:40:20.690	00:40:25.240	pregnancy suffered impaired memories and ability to learn. The researchers
606	00:40:25.250	00:40:27.680	said the amounts of carbon monoxide were similar to the
607	00:40:27.690	00:40:30.940	amounts taken in by a heavy smoker. The effect on
608	00:40:30.950	00:40:33.130	memory was said to be more pronounced, but there was
609	00:40:33.140	00:40:36.610	also an effect on learning ability. Earlier tests have shown
610	00:40:36.620	00:40:40.090	that the children of women who smoked heavily during pregnancy
611	00:40:40.100	00:40:44.960	suffer a handicap when taking achievement tests. Our next major
612	00:40:44.970	00:40:47.960	segment tonight is an update on the birth control pill.
613	00:40:47.970	00:40:52.160	Twenty-four years after it was introduced, revolutionizing birth control in
614	00:40:52.170	00:40:55.410	this country, the debate over how dangerous the pill is
615	00:40:55.420	00:41:00.660	still rages. Charlayne Hunter-Gault has the details. Charlayne? Even with
616	00:41:00.670	00:41:05.560	inconclusive results in the debate over the pill, some 150
617	00:41:05.570	00:41:09.340	million women worldwide have used it. That makes the pill
618	00:41:09.350	00:41:12.990	the most widely used form of birth control, second only
619	00:41:13.000	00:41:17.400	to sterilization. Over the years, however, various studies have linked
620	00:41:17.410	00:41:22.030	the pill to problems like increased risk of stroke, heart
621	00:41:22.040	00:41:27.060	attack, blood clots, high blood pressure, cervical cancer and breast
622	00:41:27.070	00:41:30.630	cancer. But other studies have shown that the pill also
623	00:41:30.640	00:41:35.040	has a protective effect, lowering the risk of ovarian cancer,
624	00:41:35.050	00:41:39.280	endometrial cancer, which affects the lining of the womb, and
625	00:41:39.290	00:41:44.380	pelvic inflammatory disease, the leading cause of sterility in women.
626	00:41:44.390	00:41:47.650	Occasionally the studies that are released seem to contradict each
627	00:41:47.660	00:41:51.800	other outright. For example, several studies last fall found a
628	00:41:51.810	00:41:55.720	higher rate of breast cancer, particularly among women who used
629	00:41:55.730	00:41:59.780	the pill before their first pregnancy. But last March, another
630	00:41:59.790	00:42:02.970	report by the Centers for Disease Control found just the
631	00:42:02.980	00:42:08.700	opposite. It said neither short nor long-term oral contraceptive use
632	00:42:08.710	00:42:12.760	appeared to increase a woman's risk of breast cancer. The
633	00:42:12.770	00:42:16.530	head of that study is Dr. Howard Ory, deputy director
634	00:42:16.540	00:42:20.640	of epidemiology for the CDC. He has been studying both
635	00:42:20.650	00:42:23.930	the protective effects and the drawbacks of the pill for
636	00:42:23.940	00:42:29.050	13 years. He joins us tonight from Atlanta. Dr. Ory,
637	00:42:29.060	00:42:36.040	what's your overall viewpoint about the safety of the pill?
638	00:42:36.050	00:42:38.810	Dr. Ory, in Atlanta, can you hear me? Yes, I
639	00:42:38.820	00:42:42.350	can now. Good, thank you. My question was, what's your
640	00:42:42.360	00:42:46.320	view overall about the safety of the pill? Well, I
641	00:42:46.330	00:42:50.640	think for a young healthy woman that the benefits outweigh
642	00:42:50.650	00:42:54.630	the risks. Do you want to elaborate on that a
643	00:42:54.640	00:43:00.510	little bit? Sure. I think that the major risk of
644	00:43:00.520	00:43:05.070	oral contraceptives is heart attacks and strokes. You probably said
645	00:43:05.080	00:43:07.650	this--I didn't have audio when you were at the
646	00:43:07.660	00:43:12.300	beginning. And I think that risk is mainly confined to
647	00:43:12.310	00:43:16.100	women who are over 35 and who smoke. For example,
648	00:43:16.110	00:43:19.050	I estimate that about 500 women in the U.S. a
649	00:43:19.060	00:43:21.660	year, out of the 10 million who use the pill,
650	00:43:21.670	00:43:25.110	die as a result of oral contraceptive use. And most
651	00:43:25.120	00:43:29.290	of those, probably about 400, I would estimate, are in
652	00:43:29.300	00:43:32.760	the group who are over 35 and who smoke. On
653	00:43:32.770	00:43:36.950	the other hand, young healthy women derive the benefit of
654	00:43:36.960	00:43:42.030	not getting pregnant, of course, from taking the pill, and
655	00:43:42.040	00:43:45.940	then they have many other benefits in addition to that,
656	00:43:45.950	00:43:47.440	that have a--All right, excuse me. We'll get to
657	00:43:47.450	00:43:49.560	the benefits in a minute. But let me just ask
658	00:43:49.570	00:43:53.940	you this question. How do you explain the fact that
659	00:43:53.950	00:43:57.810	there are at least three other studies that contradict your
660	00:43:57.820	00:44:00.820	conclusions about the risk of breast cancer? You say there
661	00:44:00.830	00:44:05.310	is no significant risk, but these others say there is.
662	00:44:05.320	00:44:09.360	Well, it's real difficult--I think if you look at
663	00:44:09.370	00:44:13.670	the picture overall, I think all studies, there are maybe
664	00:44:13.680	00:44:16.590	12 or 13 of them now, would say that there
665	00:44:16.600	00:44:20.860	is no increased risk of breast cancer. There are two
666	00:44:20.870	00:44:27.400	studies out now that dwell on particular subgroups of women--
667	00:44:27.410	00:44:30.550	one, women who took the pill before age 25 and
668	00:44:30.560	00:44:35.320	who used particular brands, and another that looks at women
669	00:44:35.330	00:44:38.010	who took the pill before their first birth. Both of
670	00:44:38.020	00:44:42.850	those studies together are not as large as our study
671	00:44:42.860	00:44:46.170	and they're not as representative of the U.S. either. I
672	00:44:46.180	00:44:49.990	see. Now, earlier, you said you didn't hear my delineation
673	00:44:50.000	00:44:52.390	of some of the protective effects, but I listed a
674	00:44:52.400	00:44:57.950	number of those effects. How important exactly are they in
675	00:44:57.960	00:45:01.050	weighing the risk and benefits? Well, I think that the
676	00:45:01.060	00:45:05.690	major benefit, of course, is the very powerful protection against
677	00:45:05.700	00:45:10.440	unwanted pregnancy. I think of them as an added benefit,
678	00:45:10.450	00:45:13.690	the other benefits. I wouldn't use the pill to derive
679	00:45:13.700	00:45:18.370	those benefits, but if you're using it to prevent pregnancy,
680	00:45:18.380	00:45:23.800	you'd get these additional benefits. In your view, is all
681	00:45:23.810	00:45:27.350	the evidence in on the dangers of the pill, or
682	00:45:27.360	00:45:30.870	at least enough in that you could pretty much say
683	00:45:30.880	00:45:34.750	without being worried about it that the pill is generally
684	00:45:34.760	00:45:38.280	safe for everybody to use, except for those subgroups you
685	00:45:38.290	00:45:43.680	mentioned? Well, I think we have seen about 15 to
686	00:45:43.690	00:45:49.210	20 years of epidemiologic studies on the pill. It's impossible,
687	00:45:49.220	00:45:52.100	of course, to predict what's going to happen to women
688	00:45:52.110	00:45:54.660	as they get to be 60 and 70, because there
689	00:45:54.670	00:45:56.570	are no women who took the pill who, you know,
690	00:45:56.580	00:45:59.570	who are now in their 60s and 70s. But given
691	00:45:59.580	00:46:03.630	that caveat, I think that we know the major problems
692	00:46:03.640	00:46:06.660	with the pill already. All right, thank you. We'll come
693	00:46:06.670	00:46:10.810	back. Robin? Another researcher, who sees the risks differently, is
694	00:46:10.820	00:46:13.680	Dr. Diana Petitti, who has studied the effects of the
695	00:46:13.690	00:46:16.900	pill for seven years. Dr. Pettiti is an assistant professor
696	00:46:16.910	00:46:19.800	of community medicine at the University of California at San
697	00:46:19.810	00:46:24.220	Francisco, and she joins us tonight from public station KQED.
698	00:46:24.230	00:46:28.220	Dr. Pettiti, when Dr. Ory says the benefits outweigh the
699	00:46:28.230	00:46:32.840	risks, what is your opinion? Well, it's my opinion that
700	00:46:32.850	00:46:35.690	we don't know enough yet about the relationship of oral
701	00:46:35.700	00:46:39.180	contraceptives to breast cancer to be certain that the benefits
702	00:46:39.190	00:46:49.850	outweigh the perhaps equal, but I want to reserve judgment,
703	00:46:49.860	00:46:53.650	my judgment about the ultimate risk-benefit equation until the story
704	00:46:53.660	00:46:57.720	on breast cancer is clarified. And what will clarify that?
705	00:46:57.730	00:46:59.840	Well, I hate to say, but it may be further
706	00:46:59.850	00:47:03.180	research. I see. And over how many years, do you
707	00:47:03.190	00:47:05.780	think? I don't think we'll know for certain whether or
708	00:47:05.790	00:47:08.320	not oral contraceptives have an effect on breast cancer at
709	00:47:08.330	00:47:11.900	ages 60 or 70 until women who have used oral
710	00:47:11.910	00:47:15.940	contraceptives become 60 or 70 years of age. Since oral
711	00:47:15.950	00:47:20.190	contraceptives were first marketed in the 1960s, and were only
712	00:47:20.200	00:47:23.730	used widely in perhaps the late 1960s and the early
713	00:47:23.740	00:47:27.420	'70s, it probably won't be for another 10 or 20
714	00:47:27.430	00:47:30.170	years that we have the full answer about the relationship
715	00:47:30.180	00:47:34.090	of oral contraceptives to breast cancer. Statistically, with the known
716	00:47:34.100	00:47:37.060	risks, like an increased risk of stroke or a heart
717	00:47:37.070	00:47:43.060	attack, statistically how common is that risk? Dr. Ory just
718	00:47:43.070	00:47:46.390	said 500 women out of 10 million, perhaps. Is that
719	00:47:46.400	00:47:50.680	of the order of the risk, in your view? I
720	00:47:50.690	00:47:54.300	don't--I think Dr. Ory was quoting figures for mortality.
721	00:47:54.310	00:47:56.780	I think if you add in the cases where there
722	00:47:56.790	00:47:59.480	is an event, say, of myocardial infarction or a stroke,
723	00:47:59.490	00:48:02.920	that the woman doesn't die, that the total number of
724	00:48:02.930	00:48:06.380	cases in the United States may be three to five
725	00:48:06.390	00:48:11.220	times that high. I think the risks are low--they're
726	00:48:11.230	00:48:14.560	probably lower than the risk of getting into an automobile
727	00:48:14.570	00:48:17.450	accident and becoming seriously injured if one doesn't fasten one's
728	00:48:17.460	00:48:20.590	seat belt. But that's not the question. The question is
729	00:48:20.600	00:48:23.880	whether or not oral contraceptives are more or less safe
730	00:48:23.890	00:48:26.960	than alternative forms of birth control that women might use
731	00:48:26.970	00:48:31.390	if oral contraceptives were not so--didn't have other benefits,
732	00:48:31.400	00:48:33.960	particularly the benefit of being easy to use and highly
733	00:48:33.970	00:48:38.900	effective. Now, would you recommend the birth control pill as
734	00:48:38.910	00:48:44.310	a primary, as the first form of contraception or birth
735	00:48:44.320	00:48:48.230	control? No, I wouldn't. I would recommend that all women
736	00:48:48.240	00:48:52.760	who can use barrier methods of contraception successfully--that means
737	00:48:52.770	00:48:56.000	methods of contraception such as the diaphragm or the condom,
738	00:48:56.010	00:48:59.120	or the foam and condoms, that that would be my
739	00:48:59.130	00:49:02.550	first choice of birth control for all women in the
740	00:49:02.560	00:49:06.500	United States. Of course that, I understand, lowers the effectiveness
741	00:49:06.510	00:49:09.570	of the birth control, does it not? I think the
742	00:49:09.580	00:49:13.240	effectiveness of the diaphragm and of condoms is dependent on
743	00:49:13.250	00:49:16.450	how well the person uses them. I think there's some
744	00:49:16.460	00:49:19.300	recent evidence that women over 35 who are married and
745	00:49:19.310	00:49:22.620	in a stable relationship have an effectiveness rate for use
746	00:49:22.630	00:49:24.580	of the diaphragm which is almost the same as that
747	00:49:24.590	00:49:27.880	for the pill. Are there some kind--is there one--
748	00:49:27.890	00:49:30.620	is there a category of women who in your view
749	00:49:30.630	00:49:34.560	should not be using the pill? Oh, yes, certainly. Women
750	00:49:34.570	00:49:37.410	over 35 years of age who smoke cigarettes should not
751	00:49:37.420	00:49:40.620	use the pill. Because of an increased risk of stroke
752	00:49:40.630	00:49:45.430	or heart attack? Heart attacks, strokes. And women who are
753	00:49:45.440	00:49:49.180	over 35 who do not smoke? I think there's still
754	00:49:49.190	00:49:51.820	some question. It would be my advice that women over
755	00:49:51.830	00:49:54.800	35 who don't smoke and who are certain that they're
756	00:49:54.810	00:49:58.620	not going to have any more children should consider sterilization.
757	00:49:58.630	00:50:01.890	On the other hand, for a perfectly healthy woman with
758	00:50:01.900	00:50:06.380	no family history of heart disease, I think using the
759	00:50:06.390	00:50:09.760	oral contraceptive might be reasonable, particularly if it's a low-dose
760	00:50:09.770	00:50:13.310	oral contraceptive. Well, thank you. Charlayne? Dr. Ory, what do
761	00:50:13.320	00:50:19.030	you say to Dr. Petitti's feeling that there should be
762	00:50:19.040	00:50:22.850	at least another 10 to 20 years of research before
763	00:50:22.860	00:50:26.240	you can definitively say or even recommend that women use
764	00:50:26.250	00:50:28.380	the pill? She's just not convinced that it's as safe
765	00:50:28.390	00:50:34.670	as you say. Well, I can't argue with that. On
766	00:50:34.680	00:50:38.310	the other hand, people have to make a decision today,
767	00:50:38.320	00:50:42.130	and I wouldn't throw the pill out because we're not
768	00:50:42.140	00:50:47.940	absolutely 100% certain that it's--that this, that or the
769	00:50:47.950	00:50:50.720	other thing wouldn't happen. I think we are reasonably certain
770	00:50:50.730	00:50:57.260	now that young healthy women can use it with a
771	00:50:57.270	00:51:01.610	good margin of safety. Dr. Petitti, what about that response?
772	00:51:01.620	00:51:04.040	And in addition to which, he had said earlier that
773	00:51:04.050	00:51:07.880	there are at least 12 to 13 studies, compared with
774	00:51:07.890	00:51:11.820	the two or three--12, 13 supporting his position that
775	00:51:11.830	00:51:14.420	the benefits outweigh the risks, as opposed to two or
776	00:51:14.430	00:51:18.240	three that say they don't? Well, first, I certainly agree
777	00:51:18.250	00:51:21.030	with Dr. Ory that we shouldn't throw out the pill
778	00:51:21.040	00:51:23.600	as a form of birth control. However, I think it
779	00:51:23.610	00:51:26.260	has to do with how we advocate the pill in
780	00:51:26.270	00:51:30.630	relationship to other forms of contraception with similar effectivenesses when
781	00:51:30.640	00:51:33.060	used properly. What do you mean by that? Do you
782	00:51:33.070	00:51:36.920	think the public is being misled or--Well, I think
783	00:51:36.930	00:51:41.240	that certain people are advocating the use of the pill
784	00:51:41.250	00:51:47.630	as an entirely safe form of contraception, that its benefits
785	00:51:47.640	00:51:51.000	strongly outweigh its risks and that its risks are really
786	00:51:51.010	00:51:52.470	minimal. I don't think we can say that. You mean
787	00:51:52.480	00:51:56.870	certain people like Dr. Ory? No, I haven't heard Howard
788	00:51:56.880	00:52:02.640	say that in public. Dr. Ory, is that your position?
789	00:52:02.650	00:52:07.410	No. My position is that for a young healthy woman,
790	00:52:07.420	00:52:12.820	I think--I quite agree with Diana that the safest--
791	00:52:12.830	00:52:16.760	the method of contraception that has the lowest mortality would
792	00:52:16.770	00:52:20.110	probably be to use a diaphragm or condom or some
793	00:52:20.120	00:52:23.430	barrier method, and if you get pregnant, to back that
794	00:52:23.440	00:52:27.450	up with an abortion. That, if that is morally acceptable
795	00:52:27.460	00:52:30.260	to you, is the form of birth control that has
796	00:52:30.270	00:52:35.380	the lowest mortality and complication rate. However, once you put
797	00:52:35.390	00:52:39.720	that aside, I think that, say, for people under age
798	00:52:39.730	00:52:46.150	35, that the pill, the IUD, the condom, diaphragm, if
799	00:52:46.160	00:52:49.660	you look at the overall mortality, deaths, that those women
800	00:52:49.670	00:52:57.510	face, they're about the same. What about that, Dr. Petitti?
801	00:52:57.520	00:53:00.630	I'm not quite certain whether Howard said that they're all
802	00:53:00.640	00:53:03.070	the same. I think that we don't know what's going
803	00:53:03.080	00:53:05.610	to happen with breast cancer, that there have been 13
804	00:53:05.620	00:53:08.850	or 14 studies. However, only the most recent of those
805	00:53:08.860	00:53:12.530	studies, including that of Dr. Ory, has addressed the question
806	00:53:12.540	00:53:16.200	of whether or not early use of oral contraceptives by
807	00:53:16.210	00:53:20.980	women before their first pregnancy will be entirely safe, partly
808	00:53:20.990	00:53:24.800	safe, very risky, or a little bit risky. Well, don't
809	00:53:24.810	00:53:29.110	a lot of women--perhaps not a lot of women,
810	00:53:29.120	00:53:33.540	but aren't women before the age of 25 who have
811	00:53:33.550	00:53:36.710	not had children, don't they run the risk of breast
812	00:53:36.720	00:53:40.650	cancer whether they take the pill or not? Certainly the
813	00:53:40.660	00:53:45.150	very fact of having delayed birth until later years increases
814	00:53:45.160	00:53:47.840	their risk of breast cancer. However, the studies that have
815	00:53:47.850	00:53:51.020	been published most recently have shown that use of oral
816	00:53:51.030	00:53:54.420	contraceptives for a long period of time increases their risk
817	00:53:54.430	00:53:57.830	over and above that of having delayed the age at
818	00:53:57.840	00:54:01.190	which they have their first child. Dr. Ory, if this
819	00:54:01.200	00:54:03.830	is--Can I disagree with that? Sure. I think that
820	00:54:03.840	00:54:06.800	that is--that Diana is putting her finger on what
821	00:54:06.810	00:54:09.580	I think is the problem with those two studies, the
822	00:54:09.590	00:54:12.790	Pike study and the Vessey study, they don't have enough
823	00:54:12.800	00:54:17.030	numbers to adequately control for the age that women have
824	00:54:17.040	00:54:19.690	their first child. And I think that's what our study
825	00:54:19.700	00:54:23.620	can do, and we don't see that risk. Well, I
826	00:54:23.630	00:54:27.710	had a comment about Dr. Ory's study, which was that
827	00:54:27.720	00:54:30.760	in his study, women were included up through the ages
828	00:54:30.770	00:54:34.540	of 55, and that in both of the studies that
829	00:54:34.550	00:54:38.260	found an increased risk of oral contraceptive use for breast
830	00:54:38.270	00:54:42.420	cancer in women using oral contraceptives before their first pregnancy,
831	00:54:42.430	00:54:44.590	they included women who are quite a lot younger--a
832	00:54:44.600	00:54:47.250	large number of women who were a lot younger. The
833	00:54:47.260	00:54:51.780	maximum age in Dr. Pike's study was 37 and in
834	00:54:51.790	00:54:56.820	Dr. Vessey's most recently published study about 45. And I
835	00:54:56.830	00:54:59.940	think that it's only now that we're beginning to have
836	00:54:59.950	00:55:03.620	sufficient numbers of women who have used oral contraceptives for
837	00:55:03.630	00:55:06.800	long periods of time before their first pregnancy, that we
838	00:55:06.810	00:55:09.820	can begin to answer the question. So that in my
839	00:55:09.830	00:55:13.280	opinion, many of the 10 to 13 studies of breast
840	00:55:13.290	00:55:16.250	cancer that have been done do not shed light on
841	00:55:16.260	00:55:19.010	that important question. Dr. Ory, we just have a few
842	00:55:19.020	00:55:23.470	seconds left. What's a woman who is very confused about
843	00:55:23.480	00:55:26.480	what to do, what's she to do if experts like
844	00:55:26.490	00:55:30.970	the two of you and these studies disagree? What would
845	00:55:30.980	00:55:35.570	you suggest? Well, you know, like anything else, you have
846	00:55:35.580	00:55:37.630	to weigh the evidence as best you can and make
847	00:55:37.640	00:55:41.190	a decision. I mean I don't know completely if everything
848	00:55:41.200	00:55:43.860	I eat is unhealthy or healthy to me, but I
849	00:55:43.870	00:55:47.300	make my choices and I do it. And, you know,
850	00:55:47.310	00:55:50.600	Diana and I are both looking at the same data
851	00:55:50.610	00:55:53.860	and coming up with slightly different conclusions, but I think
852	00:55:53.870	00:55:56.980	both of us are saying that the pill is a
853	00:55:56.990	00:55:59.730	reasonable form of contraception. All right, well, I'll have to
854	00:55:59.740	00:56:02.440	leave it on that interpretation and hope that Dr. Petitti
855	00:56:02.450	00:56:06.060	also meant the same thing. Thank you both. Judy? Finally
856	00:56:06.070	00:56:09.170	tonight, a story from the mountains of Southwest China, where
857	00:56:09.180	00:56:13.480	the world's only population of wild giant pandas faces the
858	00:56:13.490	00:56:16.900	danger of imminent starvation. There are fewer than a thousand
859	00:56:16.910	00:56:19.490	of these animals living in the wild, and their number
860	00:56:19.500	00:56:22.160	is expected to drop even lower because of a severe
861	00:56:22.170	00:56:26.580	shortage of bamboo, their diet staple. Experts predict the crisis
862	00:56:26.590	00:56:29.530	will worsen within six months and will continue for five
863	00:56:29.540	00:56:33.180	to eight years until the bamboo, through its natural cycle,
864	00:56:33.190	00:56:37.080	is replenished. Today, the World Wildlife Fund held a news
865	00:56:37.090	00:56:40.150	conference in Washington to explain the efforts under way to
866	00:56:40.160	00:56:46.330	save the pandas. I would estimate that about a quarter
867	00:56:46.340	00:56:51.260	of all the pandas remaining in the wild face a
868	00:56:51.270	00:56:57.290	real emergency. Now, as to the rescue methods, there are
869	00:56:57.300	00:57:04.110	really three basic kinds. One is to build some holding
870	00:57:04.120	00:57:11.790	stations where starving pandas can be taken to be rehabilitated
871	00:57:11.800	00:57:16.720	for eventual release back into the wild. Another method is
872	00:57:16.730	00:57:22.320	supplementary feeding of animals in the wild. The final, main
873	00:57:22.330	00:57:29.260	method is to transfer animals to a new habitat. When
874	00:57:29.270	00:57:33.300	you only, let's say, have a thousand animals, every single
875	00:57:33.310	00:57:39.010	one that you save has potential for considerable impact. Let’s
876	00:57:39.020	00:57:40.920	hope they do find a way to save them. Good
877	00:57:40.930	00:57:44.450	night, Robin. Good night, Judy. That's our NewsHour for tonight.
878	00:57:44.460	00:57:46.570	We will be back tomorrow night. I'm Robert MacNeil. Good
879	00:57:46.580	00:59:51.043	night.
