1	00:01:15.670	00:01:19.160	Good evening. Leading the news today, businessman Albert Hakim told
2	00:01:19.170	00:01:22.120	the Iran-Contra hearings that he put money aside for Col.
3	00:01:22.130	00:01:26.030	Oliver North's children. The Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh asked the
4	00:01:26.040	00:01:29.280	committees not to grant immunity to Col. North. New York
5	00:01:29.290	00:01:32.470	Congressman Mario Biaggi and six others were indicted in the
6	00:01:32.480	00:01:36.640	Wedtech investigation. The author of the Sullivan Code governing U.S.
7	00:01:36.650	00:01:40.740	business in South Africa advised American companies to pull out.
8	00:01:40.750	00:01:43.080	We'll have details in our news summary in a moment.
9	00:01:43.090	00:01:46.780	Jim? After the news summary, the testimony of Assistant Secretary
10	00:01:46.790	00:01:50.370	of State Elliott Abrams and Albert Hakim before the Iran-Contra
11	00:01:50.380	00:01:55.080	hearings, with reactions and analysis from Senators Inouye and Rudman,
12	00:01:55.090	00:01:58.420	the Senate Committees' Chairman and Vice Chairman. And a newsmaker
13	00:01:58.430	00:02:30.900	interview about AIDS with World Health Organization official, Dr. Jonathan Mann.
14	00:02:30.910	00:02:35.630	Albert Hakim, the Iranian-born banker for the Iran-Contra operations, testified
15	00:02:35.640	00:02:39.830	today that $200,000 in profits from Iran arms sales was
16	00:02:39.840	00:02:43.810	set aside for Oliver North's children. Hakim managed the Swiss
17	00:02:43.820	00:02:47.900	bank accounts for the arms sales contra supply operation, managed
18	00:02:47.910	00:02:51.440	by Lt. Col. North from the National Security Council. He
19	00:02:51.450	00:02:54.110	said he put aside the money for the university education
20	00:02:54.120	00:02:57.850	of North's children, but did not tell North about it.
21	00:02:57.860	00:03:01.710	I came up with the idea that Ollie had to
22	00:03:01.720	00:03:08.020	be assured and I started out by putting this money
23	00:03:08.030	00:03:14.170	aside as death benefit for him, and I had also
24	00:03:14.180	00:03:20.530	learned through scattered discussions that Ollie was not spending time
25	00:03:20.540	00:03:25.200	at home and he was not attending to his family,
26	00:03:25.210	00:03:32.100	to his kids' education, and so forth. And I had
27	00:03:32.110	00:03:38.590	become emotionally very attached to Ollie--still am, really love
28	00:03:38.600	00:03:45.840	this man--I figured that the interest on $200,000 could
29	00:03:45.850	00:03:53.100	cover a good part of a child's university education. Hakim
30	00:03:53.110	00:03:56.670	also said he was told President Reagan personally approved his
31	00:03:56.680	00:04:01.060	activities. The previous witness, Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams
32	00:04:01.070	00:04:03.890	said he still enjoyed the confidence of Secretary of State
33	00:04:03.900	00:04:08.100	George Schultz. Democratic members of the investigating committees said Abrams
34	00:04:08.110	00:04:12.170	would be forced to resign for misleading the Congress. Jim?
35	00:04:12.180	00:04:16.160	The Iran-Contra Independent Counsel asked the Select Committees today not
36	00:04:16.170	00:04:19.550	to grant immunity to Oliver North. Lawrence Walsh met with
37	00:04:19.560	00:04:22.830	the House and Senate Committee members at lunchtime. Afterward, he
38	00:04:22.840	00:04:26.570	explained his reasons for opposing immunity for the National Security
39	00:04:26.580	00:04:31.380	aide, and key figure in the Iran-Contra affair. Our reasons
40	00:04:31.390	00:04:37.280	for asking for it were, one, that Col. North is
41	00:04:37.290	00:04:41.940	a central figure in the activities that are under investigation.
42	00:04:41.950	00:04:50.120	Second, that there are now many witnesses who have been
43	00:04:50.130	00:04:56.630	giving testimony to his activity. And therefore, it may be
44	00:04:56.640	00:05:00.710	that by the time the Committee is through with the
45	00:05:00.720	00:05:06.080	testimony of Admiral Poindexter, they would not need the additional
46	00:05:06.090	00:05:09.850	testimony of Col. North. The Senate Committee's leader said a
47	00:05:09.860	00:05:13.930	decision on North's immunity will be made within 48 hours.
48	00:05:13.940	00:05:17.150	The Republican Vice Chairman, Senator Warren Rudman, said the committee
49	00:05:17.160	00:05:20.620	could not complete its work without talking to North. North
50	00:05:20.630	00:05:23.520	himself made an appearance in Federal Court in Washington this
51	00:05:23.530	00:05:27.580	afternoon. Inside the courtroom, his attorneys asked that the Independent
52	00:05:27.590	00:05:31.080	Counsel's investigation of him be stopped on grounds that the
53	00:05:31.090	00:05:35.980	law creating the Counsel is unconstitutional. The government of Iraq
54	00:05:35.990	00:05:39.400	is insisting that the USS Stark was inside a war
55	00:05:39.410	00:05:42.090	zone when it was accidentally attacked by one of their
56	00:05:42.100	00:05:45.680	planes. A Pentagon report today said the U.S. has challenged
57	00:05:45.690	00:05:49.040	that claim, saying the navy has numerous fixes showing the
58	00:05:49.050	00:05:52.180	Stark was well outside the war zone. The report said
59	00:05:52.190	00:05:55.080	the Iraqi claim was the principal difference that has persisted
60	00:05:55.090	00:05:58.840	in the joint U.S.-Iraqi investigation of the attack, which cost
61	00:05:58.850	00:06:02.860	the lives of 37 U.S. sailors. A New York Congressman
62	00:06:02.870	00:06:07.470	was indicted today on racketeering charges. Democrat Mario Biaggi was
63	00:06:07.480	00:06:11.290	accused of participating in turning the Wedtech Corporation of New
64	00:06:11.300	00:06:16.170	York into a racketeering enterprise. Wedtech is a government contractor,
65	00:06:16.180	00:06:20.660	already the target of other investigations involving allegations against Attorney
66	00:06:20.670	00:06:24.870	General Edwin Meese, among others. Today's charge alleges Biaggi, his
67	00:06:24.880	00:06:28.150	son and five others used Wedtech as a vehicle for
68	00:06:28.160	00:06:32.290	making illegal payments to public officials. Biaggi and a prosecutor
69	00:06:32.300	00:06:36.530	each talked to the press about today's indictment. These charges
70	00:06:36.540	00:06:40.460	raise serious questions about the way we practice politics and
71	00:06:40.470	00:06:43.650	conduct business in the city, state and nation. I must
72	00:06:43.660	00:06:48.520	emphasize from the outset this investigation is continuing. It has
73	00:06:48.530	00:06:51.650	not been completed, and there is much more that is
74	00:06:51.660	00:06:54.530	still under investigation and much more to go. I will
75	00:06:54.540	00:06:57.570	fight this indictment because I am innocent. I want to
76	00:06:57.580	00:07:00.860	prove that. After months of trying this case in the
77	00:07:00.870	00:07:05.800	media, the prosecution has finally come forth with an indictment.
78	00:07:05.810	00:07:09.040	The prosecutors refused my offer to submit to their lie
79	00:07:09.050	00:07:13.160	detector test, despite the fact that I earlier had passed
80	00:07:13.170	00:07:16.240	one on the key issues which were involved in the
81	00:07:16.250	00:07:20.890	investigation. A U.S. Foreign Service officer has been indicted on
82	00:07:20.900	00:07:25.310	charges of selling false U.S. entry visas to Iranians. The
83	00:07:25.320	00:07:29.450	21-count indictment was announced today in Washington, following the arrest
84	00:07:29.460	00:07:33.990	of the officer, Bernard Fennell, a 19-year State Department veteran.
85	00:07:34.000	00:07:37.040	He allegedly participated in a scheme with six others to
86	00:07:37.050	00:07:39.630	sell the visas while he was the First Secretary and
87	00:07:39.640	00:07:43.580	Counsel at the U.S. Embassy in Madrid, Spain. The Reverend
88	00:07:43.590	00:07:47.070	Leon Sullivan, who devised the code of conduct widely used
89	00:07:47.080	00:07:50.490	by American business in South Africa, called on all U.S.
90	00:07:50.500	00:07:53.660	companies to pull out in nine months. In a Washington
91	00:07:53.670	00:07:56.860	statement, the Philadelphia minister also called on the U.S. Government
92	00:07:56.870	00:08:00.640	to break off diplomatic relations and enact economic embargo of
93	00:08:00.650	00:08:03.950	South Africa. Sullivan said he no longer saw any hope
94	00:08:03.960	00:08:09.170	that his policies would change apartheid. As of May, 1985,
95	00:08:09.180	00:08:14.350	I stated it had been 24 months statutory apartheid was
96	00:08:14.360	00:08:20.200	not ended. There was not a clear commitment of the
97	00:08:20.210	00:08:25.630	vote for blacks equal to whites. I would call on
98	00:08:25.640	00:08:28.490	the companies to leave South Africa and call for an
99	00:08:28.500	00:08:36.940	American embargo. The conditions have not been remotely met, nor
100	00:08:36.950	00:08:43.320	has there been progress in that direction. Canada's political leaders
101	00:08:43.330	00:08:46.730	reached agreement today on a formula to bring French-speaking Quebec
102	00:08:46.740	00:08:49.970	into line with the new Canadian Constitution. The agreement was
103	00:08:49.980	00:08:53.290	reached in an all-night session between Prime Minister Brian Mulroney,
104	00:08:53.300	00:08:56.680	and the Premiers of Canada's ten provinces. Quebec, which has
105	00:08:56.690	00:09:00.830	1/4 of Canada's population, refused to sign the new constitution
106	00:09:00.840	00:09:03.820	six years ago, because it was not recognized as a
107	00:09:03.830	00:09:08.390	distinct society within Canada. The new formula satisfies that demand,
108	00:09:08.400	00:09:11.240	but has been widely criticized and must still be ratified
109	00:09:11.250	00:09:14.080	by federal and provincial parliaments. At one point in the
110	00:09:14.090	00:09:18.070	1970s, Quebec separatists wanted to break away from Canada to
111	00:09:18.080	00:09:22.210	form a separate nation. President Reagan flew off to Italy
112	00:09:22.220	00:09:25.480	today. He will spend five days at a villa outside
113	00:09:25.490	00:09:29.440	Venice, preparing for the Economic Summit, which begins Monday. Mr.
114	00:09:29.450	00:09:32.920	Reagan spoke briefly at a White House departure ceremony, saying
115	00:09:32.930	00:09:36.030	it was time to end trade and monetary imbalances among
116	00:09:36.040	00:09:39.770	the world industrial democracies. He also said they must work
117	00:09:39.780	00:09:45.030	to eliminate inequities in the international trade environment. Some 78,000
118	00:09:45.040	00:09:49.230	farmers, threatened with possible foreclosure, got a reprieve today. In
119	00:09:49.240	00:09:53.650	Bismarck, North Dakota, U.S. District Judge, Bruce Van Sickle, ordered
120	00:09:53.660	00:09:57.120	the Federal Farmers Home Administration to halt proceedings to collect
121	00:09:57.130	00:10:00.800	overdue loans in order to inform farmers of their rights.
122	00:10:00.810	00:10:03.710	The judge ruled recently that the agency had used illegal
123	00:10:03.720	00:10:08.840	notices to inform the borrowers of possible foreclosure proceedings. Andres
124	00:10:08.850	00:10:12.870	Segovia is dead. The world's premier classical guitarist died last
125	00:10:12.880	00:10:16.110	night of heart failure in Madrid, Spain. He was 94
126	00:10:16.120	00:10:19.230	years old. And that's it for the news summary tonight.
127	00:10:19.240	00:10:23.190	Now the testimony of Elliott Abrams and Albert Hakim, Senators
128	00:10:23.200	00:10:25.980	Inouye and Rudman, and the head of the World Health
129	00:10:25.990	00:10:39.380	Organization's AIDS Program. Our special coverage of the Iran-Contra hearings
130	00:10:39.390	00:10:42.560	is where we begin again tonight. The witnesses today were
131	00:10:42.570	00:10:47.080	Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams and businessman Albert Hakim.
132	00:10:47.090	00:10:50.650	The reporter, as usual, is Judy Woodruff. Judy? The morning
133	00:10:50.660	00:10:53.710	session of today's hearings turned into an opportunity for one
134	00:10:53.720	00:10:56.660	member of the committee after another to take shots at
135	00:10:56.670	00:11:02.180	Assistant Secretary Abrams, primarily for his misleading Congress in testimony
136	00:11:02.190	00:11:05.210	last year. But also for what they viewed as his
137	00:11:05.220	00:11:09.490	distancing himself from possibly illegal activities on behalf of the
138	00:11:09.500	00:11:13.870	Nicaraguan Contras. One of the most contentious exchanges came early
139	00:11:13.880	00:11:17.920	in the day, when Republican Senator William Cohen zeroed in
140	00:11:17.930	00:11:21.560	on what he saw as a discrepancy in Abrams' account
141	00:11:21.570	00:11:26.330	of his instructions to retired Army General John Singlaub regarding
142	00:11:26.340	00:11:31.030	Singlaub's solicitation of the governments of Taiwan and South Korea
143	00:11:31.040	00:11:33.450	for aid to the Contras. --to the Tower Board when
144	00:11:33.460	00:11:37.240	they asked you about Singlaub's efforts to solicit funds from
145	00:11:37.250	00:11:41.490	countries No. 3 and 5, you said, "I said, 'I
146	00:11:41.500	00:11:44.610	can't do that. It's just not right. I can't do
147	00:11:44.620	00:11:49.050	that.'" Do you recall that testimony? Mmmm hmmm. The problem
148	00:11:49.060	00:11:52.430	I have with that categorical statement once again, "It's just
149	00:11:52.440	00:11:55.280	not right," is that the implication is that it's some
150	00:11:55.290	00:11:58.690	sort of moral balance going on--what is right and
151	00:11:58.700	00:12:02.200	what is wrong. "It's not right for General Singlaub to
152	00:12:02.210	00:12:05.050	get this nod from me--it's just not right." That
153	00:12:05.060	00:12:07.460	in fact doesn't comport with what all the documents that
154	00:12:07.470	00:12:10.880	were being furnished to you by your direct subordinate, Mr.
155	00:12:10.890	00:12:14.710	Melton, seemed to indicate. What they indicate is that the
156	00:12:14.720	00:12:19.650	timing wasn't right. "Tell Singlaub the timing is wrong. That
157	00:12:19.660	00:12:23.980	he is in danger of jeopardizing this sophisticated strategy that
158	00:12:23.990	00:12:27.100	we have for getting the President's program through the Congress."
159	00:12:27.110	00:12:29.510	Have you read the Mr. Melton's deposition, sir? I've read
160	00:12:29.520	00:12:32.320	all the documents that were submitted to you--Well, senator,
161	00:12:32.330	00:12:36.330	he's been deposed by this committee. He has stated in
162	00:12:36.340	00:12:39.290	full, under oath, his view of all of that, and
163	00:12:39.300	00:12:41.290	I think it's a little bit unfair, frankly. But I
164	00:12:41.300	00:12:43.570	can tell you I've read it, because the committee was
165	00:12:43.580	00:12:45.670	kind enough to make it available to me. I think
166	00:12:45.680	00:12:48.720	you'll find when you read it that Mr. Melton, not
167	00:12:48.730	00:12:51.820	knowing what I testified, under oath, a career foreign service
168	00:12:51.830	00:12:53.900	officer, has a little bit of a different recollection of
169	00:12:53.910	00:12:58.320	it, in which his recollection really is--as was mine--
170	00:12:58.330	00:13:00.460	that we were really saying to General Singlaub--a man
171	00:13:00.470	00:13:03.190	for whom I have and have always had the utmost
172	00:13:03.200	00:13:06.720	respect and admiration--that we were not going to say
173	00:13:06.730	00:13:08.130	to him, "Would you please go away, we're not going
174	00:13:08.140	00:13:09.250	to help you with this," but we were going to
175	00:13:09.260	00:13:12.580	kind of try to let him down easily, because I
176	00:13:12.590	00:13:14.960	was actually sorry that there was nothing that I could
177	00:13:14.970	00:13:16.820	do to help him. But I felt there was nothing
178	00:13:16.830	00:13:18.450	I could do to help him. I think that your
179	00:13:18.460	00:13:21.740	interpretation is not that of Mr. Melton, who was a
180	00:13:21.750	00:13:24.990	career officer who attended all those meetings, and who was
181	00:13:25.000	00:13:28.610	the usual contact with General Singlaub. Then all of those
182	00:13:28.620	00:13:30.950	memos coming to you from Mr. Melton were in error
183	00:13:30.960	00:13:33.510	then? No, sir, they were not all in error. Mr.
184	00:13:33.520	00:13:36.430	Melton said in his depositions that the line in which
185	00:13:36.440	00:13:39.590	he says there was a previous deposition--I didn't say.
186	00:13:39.600	00:13:42.040	Let me move back to the issue of the Miami
187	00:13:42.050	00:13:45.960	Herald, when you complained to Mr. Abramowitz that someone in
188	00:13:45.970	00:13:52.450	his department was leaking information. You commented on this yesterday.
189	00:13:52.460	00:13:55.050	The April 30 Miami Herald piece. The question I have
190	00:13:55.060	00:13:58.690	is did you ever call Oliver North concerning this story?
191	00:13:58.700	00:14:01.530	I don't believe so. Why wouldn't you call Oliver North
192	00:14:01.540	00:14:05.660	after the Secretary had asked you to monitor his activities?
193	00:14:05.670	00:14:07.610	Here was a direct allegation that he was acting in
194	00:14:07.620	00:14:10.840	violation of the law, and you not once called Oliver
195	00:14:10.850	00:14:12.400	North to say, "Is there any truth to this story
196	00:14:12.410	00:14:15.740	in the Miami Herald?" I do not believe--let me
197	00:14:15.750	00:14:20.280	just read you something here if I could. My notes
198	00:14:20.290	00:14:24.860	of September 4, 1985, of a meeting with the Secretary.
199	00:14:24.870	00:14:29.240	One: Monitor Ollie. Two: Report to Secretary on the effectiveness
200	00:14:29.250	00:14:33.570	of the Contras. Three: Diplomatic track--very important. Keep alive.
201	00:14:33.580	00:14:37.000	Four: Economic aid--boom everywhere but Nicaragua. Look at our
202	00:14:37.010	00:14:39.730	economic resources. Get more mileage out of them. A sense
203	00:14:39.740	00:14:45.190	of momentum. Private investment. Economic development. "Monitor Ollie" is one
204	00:14:45.200	00:14:47.440	line in a very large book. It was not what
205	00:14:47.450	00:14:50.290	I was supposed to do first thing every morning. I
206	00:14:50.300	00:14:52.600	did in fact, with respect to illegal activities, as I
207	00:14:52.610	00:14:57.090	testified yesterday, ask him about whether he was doing anything
208	00:14:57.100	00:14:59.010	violative of the law, and I dealt with him pretty
209	00:14:59.020	00:15:02.920	regularly. What concerned me about this was that it was
210	00:15:02.930	00:15:05.670	not the first time that I had read about or
211	00:15:05.680	00:15:10.130	heard about intelligence officers of the department talking to the
212	00:15:10.140	00:15:13.280	press in this way--which they aren't supposed to do.
213	00:15:13.290	00:15:17.400	That was my concern for that morning. "Monitor Ollie" is
214	00:15:17.410	00:15:20.810	not an activity that is to be conducted on a
215	00:15:20.820	00:15:25.500	45-hour a week basis. But if there were rumors being
216	00:15:25.510	00:15:30.320	circulated on a 48-hour-weekly basis about his activities, you didn't
217	00:15:30.330	00:15:33.500	feel compelled at least to determine what exactly he was
218	00:15:33.510	00:15:41.200	doing? I was in pretty regular contact with him. And
219	00:15:41.210	00:15:43.350	for all I know, I did ask him about that.
220	00:15:43.360	00:15:45.290	I have no memory of asking him about that. And
221	00:15:45.300	00:15:49.780	my concern was--first of all, the Secretary did not
222	00:15:49.790	00:15:54.300	say to me, "Monitor your deputies and monitor your ambassadors,"
223	00:15:54.310	00:15:57.390	but that was my real job. Because I'm a State
224	00:15:57.400	00:16:01.410	Department officer. I don't supervise the activities of NSC officials.
225	00:16:01.420	00:16:04.320	And my concern here was what looked to me like
226	00:16:04.330	00:16:09.140	an untoward act by somebody supervised in my building. I
227	00:16:09.150	00:16:11.430	want to tell you that all of this--unfortunate as
228	00:16:11.440	00:16:14.990	it may be--is going to make it very difficult,
229	00:16:15.000	00:16:19.830	it seems to me, to have some kind of cooperation
230	00:16:19.840	00:16:22.940	or understanding or capability in working with the Congress on
231	00:16:22.950	00:16:26.930	driving the policy--if you indeed now are, and still
232	00:16:26.940	00:16:34.080	are, charged primarily with driving the policy on Contra assistance.
233	00:16:34.090	00:16:38.180	Well, I chair the interagency group, and I think I
234	00:16:38.190	00:16:42.130	would characterize it that way. Well, it's more than just
235	00:16:42.140	00:16:45.340	chairing the group, Mr. Secretary. You're going to have to
236	00:16:45.350	00:16:47.470	come on the Hill and work with all the committees
237	00:16:47.480	00:16:50.870	of Congress if the administration's program is going to have
238	00:16:50.880	00:16:58.120	a prayer of a chance. And I detect no effort
239	00:16:58.130	00:17:01.950	for strong bipartisan support. I see where we are hung
240	00:17:01.960	00:17:05.870	up with all of this question about your involvement, everybody
241	00:17:05.880	00:17:10.390	else's involvement, the NSC and the CIA and the State
242	00:17:10.400	00:17:15.150	Department and the policy issues, and we expect blithely to
243	00:17:15.160	00:17:18.320	roll up here in September and ask the Senate and
244	00:17:18.330	00:17:22.700	the House to support a program which has some merit
245	00:17:22.710	00:17:27.660	in my judgment, but is extremely debatable by a great
246	00:17:27.670	00:17:30.080	number of people both in the Congress and outside of
247	00:17:30.090	00:17:31.790	the Congress. Well, Mr. Chairman, let me just say first
248	00:17:31.800	00:17:34.150	of all, we made a decision some months ago not
249	00:17:34.160	00:17:36.090	to go to the Congress until this phase of the
250	00:17:36.100	00:17:38.700	hearings were over and we could assess what information had
251	00:17:38.710	00:17:40.580	come out. A lot of information has come out of
252	00:17:40.590	00:17:43.930	these hearings and out of the depositions connected with it--
253	00:17:43.940	00:17:47.140	which is very new to us, the State Department. But
254	00:17:47.150	00:17:49.540	secondly, I just want to say that while we all
255	00:17:49.550	00:17:52.880	go through this, you're still chairing that committee, I'm still
256	00:17:52.890	00:17:57.530	Assistant Secretary. We're still conducting business, we're still doing the
257	00:17:57.540	00:17:59.570	work not only with respect to this policy, but the
258	00:17:59.580	00:18:02.540	rest of Latin America. Ambassador Habib and I the day
259	00:18:02.550	00:18:05.660	before we started, had a lengthy meeting about his trip,
260	00:18:05.670	00:18:08.570	starting Saturday, his next trip down to Latin America through
261	00:18:08.580	00:18:12.050	Central America to the four democracies, on the question of
262	00:18:12.060	00:18:15.040	keeping the negotiating track going. So the policy still continues
263	00:18:15.050	00:18:17.600	to be implemented while we do this. Well, I can't
264	00:18:17.610	00:18:20.970	speak for you, but I can certainly speak for myself.
265	00:18:20.980	00:18:24.570	Okay? I have a great many reservations about how this
266	00:18:24.580	00:18:27.310	policy is being driven and will be driven in the
267	00:18:27.320	00:18:31.470	next several months. Even though I still support aid to
268	00:18:31.480	00:18:35.760	the Contras, for the lack of better policy, to accomplish
269	00:18:35.770	00:18:38.700	what it is we're trying to do--which is to
270	00:18:38.710	00:18:41.540	keep the communists from getting a foothold in Central America.
271	00:18:41.550	00:18:46.590	But I am not convinced that without broad bipartisan and
272	00:18:46.600	00:18:49.690	public support and support in the Congress that you're going
273	00:18:49.700	00:18:53.650	to be able to accomplish it. What we've done is--
274	00:18:53.660	00:18:56.560	it seems to me--in this whole effort--I'm talking
275	00:18:56.570	00:18:58.550	about the whole ball of wax, now, that we've been
276	00:18:58.560	00:19:07.340	talking about throughout these hearings, is almost destroyed the Contras.
277	00:19:07.350	00:19:10.520	Well, I share that fear, Mr. Chairman. And I hope
278	00:19:10.530	00:19:13.900	it's wrong. Do you think that you personally are in
279	00:19:13.910	00:19:17.010	a position to take a leadership role in rebuilding the
280	00:19:17.020	00:19:19.360	kind of trust--and someone in your position must be
281	00:19:19.370	00:19:23.190	a leader in this effort--between the Congress when it
282	00:19:23.200	00:19:25.780	has been clear before the Foreign Relations Committee, before the
283	00:19:25.790	00:19:30.500	Intelligence Committee, before the American people on national television, that
284	00:19:30.510	00:19:34.480	the wrong impression has been created by you? And that
285	00:19:34.490	00:19:37.350	even the apology which was wrought from you--or wrung
286	00:19:37.360	00:19:39.620	out of you--before the Intelligence Committee was not one
287	00:19:39.630	00:19:42.150	that you felt so strongly about that the minute you
288	00:19:42.160	00:19:43.610	stepped through the door it was so much on your
289	00:19:43.620	00:19:46.240	heart you had to render that apology before the meeting
290	00:19:46.250	00:19:48.520	ever got started? Do you think that you can play
291	00:19:48.530	00:19:53.030	a constructive role in the future to rebuild a relationship
292	00:19:53.040	00:19:56.250	of trust, given what has gone on in the past?
293	00:19:56.260	00:19:59.520	I do, Senator. I think perhaps more importantly the Secretary
294	00:19:59.530	00:20:02.160	does. But I do. And I think that--I cannot
295	00:20:02.170	00:20:04.420	promise you I'll never be misled, and I cannot promise
296	00:20:04.430	00:20:07.910	you I'll never be wrong. I'll be wrong. But the answer
297	00:20:07.920	00:20:09.940	to your question is "yes." I have to say to
298	00:20:09.950	00:20:14.090	you--and I'm sorry to say this--that as one
299	00:20:14.100	00:20:16.200	who feels very strongly that we must begin again from
300	00:20:16.210	00:20:20.420	this point forward to rebuild a bipartisan foreign policy, particularly
301	00:20:20.430	00:20:22.650	in Central America, that we have to rebuild trust so
302	00:20:22.660	00:20:25.600	that the Congress and Executive Branch can work together to
303	00:20:25.610	00:20:29.300	put our Central American policy back together--that I'm afraid
304	00:20:29.310	00:20:31.680	there's too much on the record at this point for
305	00:20:31.690	00:20:33.640	you to be able to effectively play that role. And
306	00:20:33.650	00:20:35.490	I'm sorry to say that. But it's something that I
307	00:20:35.500	00:20:38.370	strongly feel, and I hope you'll ponder it. Well, thank
308	00:20:38.380	00:20:41.710	you, Senator. If you'll give me the privilege of replying--
309	00:20:41.720	00:20:44.790	I'm sorry you feel that way. And I hope that
310	00:20:44.800	00:20:47.780	the briefings that I have given on about 10 occasions
311	00:20:47.790	00:20:52.200	since then to the Intelligence Committee and its staff have
312	00:20:52.210	00:20:55.350	revealed the fact that we are working together and will
313	00:20:55.360	00:20:57.330	continue to work together. And I hope to continue to
314	00:20:57.340	00:21:00.090	work together with Congress. It seems obvious you took your
315	00:21:00.100	00:21:04.360	job very seriously. I suspect you were probably even impressed
316	00:21:04.370	00:21:07.070	with the influence you're supposed to have--would want to
317	00:21:07.080	00:21:10.820	impress Congress and the Secretary of State and the President.
318	00:21:10.830	00:21:11.660	I didn't need to impress the Secretary, he gave me
319	00:21:11.670	00:21:12.620	the job, sir.--with how well you carried out your
320	00:21:12.630	00:21:15.810	duties. You did want to do a good job, didn't
321	00:21:15.820	00:21:19.460	you? Sure. Well, I'm very troubled with the job that
322	00:21:19.470	00:21:23.750	you did. Because you would have us believe that you
323	00:21:23.760	00:21:29.240	just had no idea about private fundraising, about solicitation to
324	00:21:29.250	00:21:31.940	foreign governments for a few million dollars. You had no
325	00:21:31.950	00:21:36.080	idea about how the Contras were operating, or where they
326	00:21:36.090	00:21:39.020	were getting their supplies. You had no idea about a
327	00:21:39.030	00:21:43.340	large number of people who were commuting almost daily between
328	00:21:43.350	00:21:47.260	the United States and your area of surveillance. And yet
329	00:21:47.270	00:21:49.420	these missions went on for months while you were in
330	00:21:49.430	00:21:54.260	office. Now, Mr. Abrams--Well, I'd just take exception to
331	00:21:54.270	00:21:56.000	that. I never said I had no idea about most
332	00:21:56.010	00:21:57.490	of the things you said I said I had no
333	00:21:57.500	00:22:00.410	idea about. Now, I understand that you haven't said you
334	00:22:00.420	00:22:04.300	knew anything about them. You are the only man I
335	00:22:04.310	00:22:08.210	ever saw that takes more pride in not knowing anything
336	00:22:08.220	00:22:11.280	than anybody I ever saw. Most people take pride and
337	00:22:11.290	00:22:13.740	are smug about knowledge. Well, I take exception--You seem
338	00:22:13.750	00:22:16.900	to be very proud of not knowing anything about the
339	00:22:16.910	00:22:20.300	technical problems and the real sticky problems with which you
340	00:22:20.310	00:22:23.290	are involved. Now, I believe you'd have been a lot
341	00:22:23.300	00:22:27.710	better informed if you'd been reading the daily newspapers, listening
342	00:22:27.720	00:22:31.580	to TV, listening to the radio. And I can only
343	00:22:31.590	00:22:38.780	conclude after this that you're either extremely incompetent, or that
344	00:22:38.790	00:22:43.170	you are still as I say, deceiving us with semantics.
345	00:22:43.180	00:22:47.260	Or, three, maybe the administration has intentionally kept you in
346	00:22:47.270	00:22:50.680	the dark on all these matters. So then you can
347	00:22:50.690	00:22:55.160	come down and blatantly mislead us, the Secretary of State
348	00:22:55.170	00:22:57.520	and the American people on all of these issues we've
349	00:22:57.530	00:23:00.660	been discussing. And I am deeply troubled by it and
350	00:23:00.670	00:23:04.640	wonder if you can survive as Assistant Secretary of State.
351	00:23:04.650	00:23:07.300	Well, fortunately, Mr.--balance of my time, Mr. Chairman--if
352	00:23:07.310	00:23:10.830	I can respond to that, Mr. Brooks. Let him talk.
353	00:23:10.840	00:23:13.350	Thank you. Fortunately, I guess I have to say I
354	00:23:13.360	00:23:15.020	don't work for you, I work for George Shultz, and
355	00:23:15.030	00:23:16.970	he seems to be pretty satisfied with the job I've
356	00:23:16.980	00:23:20.180	done for him. That makes me very happy and very
357	00:23:20.190	00:23:24.270	proud. And me. The characterization that you have made of
358	00:23:24.280	00:23:27.010	my testimony here yesterday and previous testimony, I think is
359	00:23:27.020	00:23:30.160	in too many ways to state in a brief answer
360	00:23:30.170	00:23:33.450	erroneous. I wouldn't think as you'd agree with one bit
361	00:23:33.460	00:23:36.130	of it. Now, I just suggest to you that I've
362	00:23:36.140	00:23:38.680	appreciated your testimony. You've been forthright, and you've come forward
363	00:23:38.690	00:23:40.410	here, and I heard your testimony in front of the
364	00:23:40.420	00:23:43.220	Intelligence Committee as well. And I do understand some of
365	00:23:43.230	00:23:47.630	the difficulties between answering everything and just spilling your guts
366	00:23:47.640	00:23:50.670	before the committee or waiting until they ask the appropriate
367	00:23:50.680	00:23:53.020	or right question. And I think there's a lot of
368	00:23:53.030	00:23:55.250	that goes on, and I can't blame you, because of
369	00:23:55.260	00:23:59.710	the loss of information that has occurred from those two
370	00:23:59.720	00:24:02.090	committees--the House and the Senate, the Intelligence Committees over
371	00:24:02.100	00:24:05.450	the last number of years. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. For
372	00:24:05.460	00:24:08.180	whatever reasons--and I don't want to judge those reasons--
373	00:24:08.190	00:24:10.560	you did not ask the questions that you should have
374	00:24:10.570	00:24:16.110	asked about the private network. You looked the other way.
375	00:24:16.120	00:24:18.940	You chose not to be informed about a key element
376	00:24:18.950	00:24:24.170	of policy directly under your jurisdiction. Now, let me try
377	00:24:24.180	00:24:30.460	to conclude. We cannot advance United States interests if public
378	00:24:30.470	00:24:37.180	officials who testify before the Congress resort to legalisms and
379	00:24:37.190	00:24:42.840	word games, claim ignorance about things they either know about,
380	00:24:42.850	00:24:47.840	or should know about, and at critical points tell the
381	00:24:47.850	00:24:53.510	Congress things that are not true. I'm aware--and I
382	00:24:53.520	00:24:55.770	don't need to be reminded--that the performance of the
383	00:24:55.780	00:24:58.630	Congress in all of this is not flawless. I happen
384	00:24:58.640	00:25:01.700	to agree with your observation the other day that this
385	00:25:01.710	00:25:05.200	humanitarian aid program that we've asked you to administer was
386	00:25:05.210	00:25:09.810	simply unworkable. And neither you nor anybody else could administer
387	00:25:09.820	00:25:14.710	it well. But I hope you recognize that the Congress
388	00:25:14.720	00:25:18.820	cannot play its constitutional role if it cannot trust the
389	00:25:18.830	00:25:24.380	testimony of representatives of the President as truthful and fully
390	00:25:24.390	00:25:29.500	informed. I would hope that future witnesses would take the
391	00:25:29.510	00:25:36.900	statement made by Chairman Hamilton very seriously. Because I don't
392	00:25:36.910	00:25:41.280	think we can stand too many days such as this,
393	00:25:41.290	00:25:49.790	listening to testimony which would question great heroes of ours.
394	00:25:49.800	00:25:55.100	I don't know whether to believe you or General Singlaub.
395	00:25:55.110	00:26:01.720	To believe you or Ambassador Tambs. And it's not my
396	00:26:01.730	00:26:03.990	job to decide whether you or the other one is
397	00:26:04.000	00:26:08.360	honest. But someone is not being honest with us. After
398	00:26:08.370	00:26:10.910	all the members had had a chance to say their
399	00:26:10.920	00:26:14.500	piece, Abrams said his. He read a closing statement, not
400	00:26:14.510	00:26:17.130	so much in defense of his actions, but in defense
401	00:26:17.140	00:26:21.690	of his beliefs. The challenge we face is great. A
402	00:26:21.700	00:26:24.730	Soviet effort to achieve domination of the region between the
403	00:26:24.740	00:26:28.260	Panama Canal and Mexico, which would constitute a change in
404	00:26:28.270	00:26:33.610	the fundamental security situation our country has enjoyed since 1789.
405	00:26:33.620	00:26:35.500	Not only would the human rights and democratic gains of
406	00:26:35.510	00:26:39.200	the '80s be lost at unspeakable human costs, but our
407	00:26:39.210	00:26:41.940	ability to defend our neighborhood and to project power in
408	00:26:41.950	00:26:45.880	the world would be irrevocably compromised. I pray we will
409	00:26:45.890	00:26:49.260	be able to put aside our differences and our institutional
410	00:26:49.270	00:26:51.880	biases and act as a great nation to help our
411	00:26:51.890	00:26:54.870	friends and challenge our enemies and protect our freedom and
412	00:26:54.880	00:26:58.980	security now, before the cost is so high that it
413	00:26:58.990	00:27:01.830	is measured not in dollars, but in blood and in
414	00:27:01.840	00:27:07.000	tears. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. This afternoon, the
415	00:27:07.010	00:27:10.730	committees heard from the long-awaited business partner of retired Air
416	00:27:10.740	00:27:17.220	Force General Richard Secord, Iranian-American businessman Albert Hakim. Hakim's testimony
417	00:27:17.230	00:27:20.210	had been postponed for more than a week, because committee
418	00:27:20.220	00:27:22.720	staff said he produced so many new leads for them
419	00:27:22.730	00:27:28.200	to follow up. Fifty-one-year-old Albert Hakim met General Secord in
420	00:27:28.210	00:27:32.110	Iran in the mid-1970s when Secord was head of the
421	00:27:32.120	00:27:36.700	U.S. group advising the Shah's air force. Hakim was cultivating
422	00:27:36.710	00:27:41.000	military contacts as an agent for European and American arms
423	00:27:41.010	00:27:44.900	companies. After Secord retired from the Air Force, he joined
424	00:27:44.910	00:27:49.820	Hakim's firm, Stanford Technology. They handled the sale of U.S.
425	00:27:49.830	00:27:53.830	weapons to Iran. And directed the air resupply to the
426	00:27:53.840	00:27:59.680	Nicaraguan Contras. Secord managed the operations end, while Hakim managed
427	00:27:59.690	00:28:02.880	the money and set up the network of shell companies
428	00:28:02.890	00:28:07.060	and bank accounts used in the operation. In all, fourty-eight
429	00:28:07.070	00:28:12.260	million dollars moved through Hakim's accounts. According to Secord, Hakim
430	00:28:12.270	00:28:16.270	still controls nearly $8 million in profit from the weapons
431	00:28:16.280	00:28:20.640	deals. Before he was questioned by Chief House Counsel John
432	00:28:20.650	00:28:24.880	Nields, Hakim read an opening statement stating his belief that
433	00:28:24.890	00:28:28.640	his involvement in the Iran-Contra network was on behalf of
434	00:28:28.650	00:28:31.910	the President of the United States. I was told that
435	00:28:31.920	00:28:36.640	our Contra activities were being undertaken not only with approval
436	00:28:36.650	00:28:40.290	by, but at the request of, the President of the
437	00:28:40.300	00:28:45.570	United States. We were dealing directly with the White House
438	00:28:45.580	00:28:51.690	staff. Consequently, it never occurred to me as a private
439	00:28:51.700	00:29:00.520	citizen, independently to investigate the legality of the President's policy.
440	00:29:00.530	00:29:06.020	With respect to Iran initiative, the same basic facts are
441	00:29:06.030	00:29:11.910	also true. I intended to profit from my activities and
442	00:29:11.920	00:29:19.280	I never made any pretense about that fact. Moreover, I
443	00:29:19.290	00:29:24.370	had the same assurances regarding the legality of our efforts,
444	00:29:24.380	00:29:27.890	and I was told that the President of the United
445	00:29:27.900	00:29:35.840	States had personally signed an order authorizing our activities. As
446	00:29:35.850	00:29:41.480	a private businessman, and as a naturalized American citizen, devoted
447	00:29:41.490	00:29:46.180	to this country, I considered it an honor to be
448	00:29:46.190	00:29:49.260	called upon by the office of the President of the
449	00:29:49.270	00:29:54.280	United States to render meaningful assistance to my country. Nields
450	00:29:54.290	00:29:57.380	took Hakim through the many Swiss bank accounts that he
451	00:29:57.390	00:30:01.170	had established for the Iran-Contra network. But one account in
452	00:30:01.180	00:30:04.370	particular was set up for personal reasons. Now, the last
453	00:30:04.380	00:30:11.380	account is the button account. It has $200,000 in it,
454	00:30:11.390	00:30:13.910	and your records reflect that amount was put in a
455	00:30:13.920	00:30:19.850	button account on May 20th, 1986. Actually, the complete name
456	00:30:19.860	00:30:27.190	is Belly Button, and this was a name that I
457	00:30:27.200	00:30:31.780	decided to use at a time because we laughed about
458	00:30:31.790	00:30:35.450	a joke and simply took the name and used it
459	00:30:35.460	00:30:40.120	for this set aside. Does it refer to a person?
460	00:30:40.130	00:30:48.060	I--yes, it does. Who? Lt. Col. North. Now, can
461	00:30:48.070	00:30:53.880	you explain the circumstances surrounding the setting up of an
462	00:30:53.890	00:31:02.240	account for Lt. Col. North? I had become extremely fond
463	00:31:02.250	00:31:10.480	of Lt. Col. North--to me, he's an amazing person.
464	00:31:10.490	00:31:19.270	I noticed something this man that--he's got two loves.
465	00:31:19.280	00:31:24.860	One is his country, to a point that in my
466	00:31:24.870	00:31:29.670	mind the biggest satisfaction that can be given to him
467	00:31:29.680	00:31:32.710	if he would enter into an environment that he could
468	00:31:32.720	00:31:36.240	get killed for his country. I sensed that so many
469	00:31:36.250	00:31:41.650	times. The other love that he has is his family.
470	00:31:41.660	00:31:49.000	And especially during the time of the second channel, I
471	00:31:49.010	00:31:54.390	witnessed him being torn apart between these two loves. But
472	00:31:54.400	00:32:01.160	coming back to how this thing came about, I came
473	00:32:01.170	00:32:07.870	up with the idea that Ollie had to be assured,
474	00:32:07.880	00:32:11.830	and started out with putting this money aside as death
475	00:32:11.840	00:32:18.610	benefit for him. And I had also learned through scattered
476	00:32:18.620	00:32:24.010	discussions--it was not that there was one discussion that
477	00:32:24.020	00:32:30.990	this issue was analyzed--I had heard through various remarks--
478	00:32:31.000	00:32:35.990	that Ollie was not spending time at home, and he
479	00:32:36.000	00:32:41.810	was not attending to his family, to his kids' education,
480	00:32:41.820	00:32:48.550	and so forth. And I had become emotionally very attached
481	00:32:48.560	00:32:53.980	to Ollie--still am--and really love this man. Did
482	00:32:53.990	00:33:01.520	you tell Col. North that you'd set this money aside?
483	00:33:01.530	00:33:08.960	I cannot recall having ever told Col. North that I
484	00:33:08.970	00:33:17.230	had set money aside for his family's benefit. But I
485	00:33:17.240	00:33:24.800	do recall my reaction to the times that we were
486	00:33:24.810	00:33:31.690	discussing his family problem, basically for not being able to
487	00:33:31.700	00:33:38.130	attend to his family, and also his concern about the
488	00:33:38.140	00:33:43.130	education of his kids and his concern what would happen
489	00:33:43.140	00:33:47.750	if he should get killed, and so on. The way
490	00:33:47.760	00:33:53.710	I remarked to him was, "Ollie, you are part of
491	00:33:53.720	00:33:56.850	the family. For as long as one of us is
492	00:33:56.860	00:34:01.590	alive, you need not worry about your family. Did you
493	00:34:01.600	00:34:06.930	ever take any steps to get some part of this
494	00:34:06.940	00:34:12.190	money or any other money into his possession for his
495	00:34:12.200	00:34:21.750	children's education? The answer is yes. I consulted Mr. Zucker
496	00:34:21.760	00:34:29.730	and I gave him an Iranian proverb. I told him
497	00:34:29.740	00:34:34.160	I want to do this but the proverb is "if
498	00:34:34.170	00:34:35.750	you want to fix the eyebrow, we don't want to
499	00:34:35.760	00:34:41.500	blind the eye," meaning that I want to find a
500	00:34:41.510	00:34:49.000	proper way of getting this money to his kid without
501	00:34:49.010	00:34:55.510	compromising Ollie's position or his family. The idea that we
502	00:34:55.520	00:35:01.000	came up with was maybe we could arrange for a
503	00:35:01.010	00:35:08.710	part time job for Mrs. North and since we did
504	00:35:08.720	00:35:15.060	not know what the qualifications of Mrs. North were, we
505	00:35:15.070	00:35:23.610	decided maybe if Mrs. Zucker could find someone that could
506	00:35:23.620	00:35:26.950	offer that position to her, and even if she did
507	00:35:26.960	00:35:32.310	not qualify we could make use of the button set
508	00:35:32.320	00:35:41.290	aside to cover her salary. Mr. Zucker told me that
509	00:35:41.300	00:35:49.560	he knew of a real estate developer that he was
510	00:35:49.570	00:35:52.400	going to contact and see if he could find a
511	00:35:52.410	00:35:58.750	way of approaching the problem that way. And that was
512	00:35:58.760	00:36:03.940	the last time that we discussed about this issue, and
513	00:36:03.950	00:36:10.330	to the best of my knowledge, no money was sent
514	00:36:10.340	00:36:15.530	to North's family, and no proper solution was found. Just
515	00:36:15.540	00:36:18.320	so we understand, the idea of this real estate development
516	00:36:18.330	00:36:22.890	company was to have that company pay Mrs. North some
517	00:36:22.900	00:36:26.420	kind of a salary and to have the button account
518	00:36:26.430	00:36:30.310	pay the real estate company. That is correct. Hakim said
519	00:36:30.320	00:36:34.300	as far as he knows, the entire $200,000 set aside
520	00:36:34.310	00:36:37.420	for North's family is still sitting in a bank earning
521	00:36:37.430	00:36:40.830	interest. In other testimony, Hakim said he became involved in
522	00:36:40.840	00:36:44.300	the Iranian-Contra project both because of his love for his
523	00:36:44.310	00:36:47.790	two countries, Iran and the United States, and because of
524	00:36:47.800	00:36:50.570	his desire to make a profit. Hakim returns to the
525	00:36:50.580	00:36:54.910	witness table tomorrow. Robin? On several fronts, this has been
526	00:36:54.920	00:36:57.150	a busier day than normal for the senior members of
527	00:36:57.160	00:37:00.410	the Select Committee. For their perspective on today's events, we
528	00:37:00.420	00:37:02.700	have with us the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the
529	00:37:02.710	00:37:07.030	Senate Committee, Democrat Daniel Inouye of Hawaii and Republican Warren
530	00:37:07.040	00:37:09.310	Rudman of New Hampshire. They join us from the Senate
531	00:37:09.320	00:37:14.950	Gallery. Senator Inouye, what is the significance of Hakim's testimony
532	00:37:14.960	00:37:18.940	about the fund for North's family? Well, it's mind-boggling, to
533	00:37:18.950	00:37:22.450	say the least. If you can imagine the scenario where
534	00:37:22.460	00:37:26.430	a total stranger calls up your wife and says, "My
535	00:37:26.440	00:37:30.650	name is Zucker. I'm representing a person who wants to
536	00:37:30.660	00:37:35.240	remain anonymous. Will you please join me at a law
537	00:37:35.250	00:37:42.190	firm of such-and-such in Philadelphia?" And she goes there. Now
538	00:37:42.200	00:37:44.710	any wife with any sort of relationship with her husband
539	00:37:44.720	00:37:48.460	would first of all discuss this matter with her husband.
540	00:37:48.470	00:37:50.770	And in this case, the husband would know who Mr.
541	00:37:50.780	00:37:55.700	Zucker was. And so to suggest that if this scenario
542	00:37:55.710	00:37:58.480	had been carried out that Col. North wasn't aware of
543	00:37:58.490	00:38:03.110	what was happening is asking for too much. Does this
544	00:38:03.120	00:38:06.590	suggest to you--I don't want to put words or
545	00:38:06.600	00:38:08.490	thoughts in your head--but does it suggest to you
546	00:38:08.500	00:38:12.100	that this investigation has taken a different turn because up
547	00:38:12.110	00:38:15.940	'til now the principals who were officials of the United
548	00:38:15.950	00:38:18.570	States--there's been no suggestion of any monetary gain in
549	00:38:18.580	00:38:23.850	this? Well, in the case of both of us sitting
550	00:38:23.860	00:38:26.790	here, this did not come as a surprise, because we
551	00:38:26.800	00:38:31.290	were made privy to the deposition. But as you pointed
552	00:38:31.300	00:38:33.930	out, it does put a new twist to the whole
553	00:38:33.940	00:38:38.560	thing. It's not a happy one. Senator Rudman, what about
554	00:38:38.570	00:38:42.530	Hakim's statement with which he began his testimony--that he
555	00:38:42.540	00:38:46.410	was told President Reagan had approved--and in one case
556	00:38:46.420	00:38:50.330	signed--an order authorizing these activities. Well, what he referred
557	00:38:50.340	00:38:54.120	to, Robin, was that the President had authorized the sale
558	00:38:54.130	00:38:59.210	of arms to Iran. That's true. Mr. Hakim, I do
559	00:38:59.220	00:39:03.870	not believe, referred to any activities. I see. In the
560	00:39:03.880	00:39:08.000	lunch break, gentlemen, you met with the Independent Counsel Lawrence
561	00:39:08.010	00:39:11.200	Walsh, who asked you not to grant immunity to Col.
562	00:39:11.210	00:39:15.600	North. Are you reluctant to agree with him, Senator Inouye?
563	00:39:15.610	00:39:20.150	Mr. Hakim's testimony this afternoon makes it very clear as
564	00:39:20.160	00:39:24.280	far as I'm concerned that Mr. North must appear before
565	00:39:24.290	00:39:30.930	the committee and testify, because Mr. Hakim has unfortunately placed
566	00:39:30.940	00:39:33.800	a cloud over the Presidency of the United States. He
567	00:39:33.810	00:39:37.980	made it without equivocation suggesting that the President of the
568	00:39:37.990	00:39:43.880	United States was not only aware, but authorized these activities.
569	00:39:43.890	00:39:47.000	And I think we need the testimony of Col. North
570	00:39:47.010	00:39:51.610	to either corroborate or deny this. Robin, let me simply
571	00:39:51.620	00:39:54.030	add that there is no question in my mind--or
572	00:39:54.040	00:39:55.800	really in the mind of any member of either committee
573	00:39:55.810	00:39:58.360	I spoke to today after the meeting with Judge Walsh--
574	00:39:58.370	00:40:01.070	that of course the Congress of the United States must
575	00:40:01.080	00:40:03.880	hear from Oliver North. Oliver North was one of the
576	00:40:03.890	00:40:06.870	people who claims to be close to the President. We
577	00:40:06.880	00:40:10.190	have testimony of his allegations of telling the President certain
578	00:40:10.200	00:40:12.950	things, which frankly I happen to think will be proven
579	00:40:12.960	00:40:17.050	false. But this Congress could not possibly allow these hearings
580	00:40:17.060	00:40:20.110	to conclude without hearing from Oliver North. And in addition
581	00:40:20.120	00:40:22.620	to that, I would say here publicly that with the
582	00:40:22.630	00:40:26.010	disclosures today--and there may be explanations for them--I
583	00:40:26.020	00:40:30.030	still hope that Col. North will come forward like Bud
584	00:40:30.040	00:40:35.240	McFarlane came forward--and testify voluntarily and take his chances.
585	00:40:35.250	00:40:39.760	How long does Mr. Walsh want you to delay granting
586	00:40:39.770	00:40:42.940	immunity--indefinitely or for a further period? I mean, he's
587	00:40:42.950	00:40:45.340	already asked and you've agreed to delay it until a
588	00:40:45.350	00:40:47.780	certain point in June. Well, there's not much more time
589	00:40:47.790	00:40:49.950	to delay if we want to finish these hearings by
590	00:40:49.960	00:40:53.660	the August recess. So it really was basically a request
591	00:40:53.670	00:40:56.930	to indefinitely postpone or to do something. And we'll try
592	00:40:56.940	00:40:59.410	to accommodate him as best we can, but in my
593	00:40:59.420	00:41:01.010	view--I can't speak for the other members of the
594	00:41:01.020	00:41:03.270	committees, I think the chairman agrees with me that Col.
595	00:41:03.280	00:41:09.560	North will be heard in July. Absolutely. I see. Mr.
596	00:41:09.570	00:41:15.800	Rudman--I'm sorry. Senator Inouye, from what you said, and
597	00:41:15.810	00:41:19.500	we quoted you in that excerpt from the hearings, did
598	00:41:19.510	00:41:26.010	you find Mr. Abrams a credible witness? I found Mr.
599	00:41:26.020	00:41:32.680	Abrams to be an important witness with much to say.
600	00:41:32.690	00:41:36.950	But because, for one thing, it shows what the government
601	00:41:36.960	00:41:40.560	of the United States was going through during this period:
602	00:41:40.570	00:41:45.770	deception for one thing, nondisclosure to the Congress of the
603	00:41:45.780	00:41:49.720	United States, keeping information away from the people of the
604	00:41:49.730	00:41:56.210	United States. And I think Secretary Abrams demonstrated in a
605	00:41:56.220	00:42:00.280	very dramatic way how this was being done. And I
606	00:42:00.290	00:42:03.400	think it's an unfortunate chapter, but it had to be
607	00:42:03.410	00:42:06.560	opened. You said you didn't know whom to believe, him
608	00:42:06.570	00:42:09.920	or Ambassador Tambs. Well, we are not prosecutors. If we
609	00:42:09.930	00:42:13.470	were prosecutors, or court, we would decide who to believe.
610	00:42:13.480	00:42:16.270	But in our case, all we do is bring the
611	00:42:16.280	00:42:18.850	facts out. Senator Rudman, what did you mean by the
612	00:42:18.860	00:42:23.020	expression, "Curiosity would kill the cat."? Well, let me simply
613	00:42:23.030	00:42:26.500	say that it is my impression, after listening to this
614	00:42:26.510	00:42:31.340	witness, Mr. Abrams, and others, that they were operating in
615	00:42:31.350	00:42:33.880	kind of a twilight zone, and the way they decided
616	00:42:33.890	00:42:37.630	to protect themselves was to not get terribly curious about
617	00:42:37.640	00:42:41.810	things they didn't have to get curious about. And my
618	00:42:41.820	00:42:45.980	point to him about the Hasenfus shootdown was he was
619	00:42:45.990	00:42:49.670	put in the position of misrepresenting to the American people
620	00:42:49.680	00:42:53.670	and the country and the President and the Secretary of
621	00:42:53.680	00:42:56.940	State, his boss, for about almost three weeks, facts that
622	00:42:56.950	00:43:01.200	were totally untrue. I happen to believe that Secretary Abrams
623	00:43:01.210	00:43:03.900	believed what he said publicly at that time. I think
624	00:43:03.910	00:43:06.380	he was misled. He was lied to, he was deceived,
625	00:43:06.390	00:43:10.430	he was betrayed. But why didn't he push hard and
626	00:43:10.440	00:43:13.160	find out what was going on? We all had our
627	00:43:13.170	00:43:17.210	suspicion. That's what I meant. I said, "Curiosity killed the
628	00:43:17.220	00:43:20.170	cat." And in this case, Mr. Abrams thought himself as
629	00:43:20.180	00:43:23.140	the cat. Senator Inouye, do you think Mr. Abrams is
630	00:43:23.150	00:43:27.830	still misleading the Congress? No, I believe he is telling
631	00:43:27.840	00:43:32.360	us what he believes to be the truth. And as
632	00:43:32.370	00:43:35.190	my colleague pointed out, I think the evidence indicates that
633	00:43:35.200	00:43:39.350	he has been either misled or kept in the dark
634	00:43:39.360	00:43:44.460	in many cases. But the phrase that Brother Rudman used
635	00:43:44.470	00:43:49.890	is most appropriate. Because here you find a situation where
636	00:43:49.900	00:43:53.570	time, valuable time, was being spent to decide and debate
637	00:43:53.580	00:43:58.030	upon whether a wristwatch is a lethal weapon or humanitarian
638	00:43:58.040	00:44:03.360	device. And yet there's no curiosity as to the Miami
639	00:44:03.370	00:44:07.350	Herald article which indicated very clearly that Col. North was
640	00:44:07.360	00:44:11.640	doing something less than legal. And the Hasenfus one was
641	00:44:11.650	00:44:15.630	front page all over the United States. Well, what does
642	00:44:15.640	00:44:19.840	that suggest to you? Well, as Senator Rudman indicated, on
643	00:44:19.850	00:44:23.460	certain things they're not curious. It seems to me again,
644	00:44:23.470	00:44:27.090	Robin, that in those circumstances, Abrams, who is tough, he
645	00:44:27.100	00:44:30.470	is savvy, he is bright, all of us who have
646	00:44:30.480	00:44:32.260	dealt with him have a lot of respect for his
647	00:44:32.270	00:44:36.750	abilities--certainly he was under some obligation if not to
648	00:44:36.760	00:44:39.980	anyone other than himself, as not to simply say, "Well,
649	00:44:39.990	00:44:42.250	I trust my colleagues," but to go in there, close
650	00:44:42.260	00:44:44.940	the door and have it out before he'd go hanging
651	00:44:44.950	00:44:48.290	out there and misrepresenting not just himself but the entire
652	00:44:48.300	00:44:51.030	position of this government. So I really think that is
653	00:44:51.040	00:44:54.870	what I am most critical of and said so. The
654	00:44:54.880	00:45:00.720	Hasenfus incident occurred in his watch in Nicaragua. It did
655	00:45:00.730	00:45:05.600	not happen in Africa or Asia. This is his bailiwick.
656	00:45:05.610	00:45:08.280	Do you share the sentiments of those members of your
657	00:45:08.290	00:45:14.270	committees today who suggested that his credibility to continuing as
658	00:45:14.280	00:45:17.340	Assistant Secretary for future relations with the Congress has been
659	00:45:17.350	00:45:21.600	so impaired that he could not continue in that role?
660	00:45:21.610	00:45:25.350	I would not go that far. I think a person
661	00:45:25.360	00:45:29.630	should be given at least a second chance. Mr. Rudman?
662	00:45:29.640	00:45:32.340	I think Elliott Abrams--and I don't disagree with the
663	00:45:32.350	00:45:34.280	chairman, but I must say that when you have the
664	00:45:34.290	00:45:38.350	chairman of the House Foreign Relations Committee saying what he
665	00:45:38.360	00:45:41.420	said, when you have the Chairman of the Senate Intelligence
666	00:45:41.430	00:45:44.880	Committee making an even stronger statement, you know, whether he
667	00:45:44.890	00:45:47.200	has credibility or not is not the issue. The question
668	00:45:47.210	00:45:49.980	is can he be effective? And I must say that
669	00:45:49.990	00:45:52.000	Elliott will have to decide that for himself. But I
670	00:45:52.010	00:45:56.030	do have some doubts after hearing today's testimony. Finally, gentlemen,
671	00:45:56.040	00:45:59.420	Senator Inouye, at this stage in the investigations what is
672	00:45:59.430	00:46:02.870	the major hole that remains in this story? What do
673	00:46:02.880	00:46:06.040	you not yet understand that you want to know? The
674	00:46:06.050	00:46:10.700	major hole will be filled hopefully by Admiral Poindexter and
675	00:46:10.710	00:46:14.680	Lt. Col. North. And I would add to that probably
676	00:46:14.690	00:46:18.280	Don Regan, possibly some of the other major members of
677	00:46:18.290	00:46:21.420	the Cabinet. As you know, Robin, the committee divided hearings
678	00:46:21.430	00:46:24.230	into two phases. Phase one, mainly to do with the
679	00:46:24.240	00:46:27.560	Contra activity of the NSC. And Phase two, the Iran
680	00:46:27.570	00:46:30.330	arms sale. And of course all of that reflects on
681	00:46:30.340	00:46:32.690	the President's knowledge. And I think we owe it to
682	00:46:32.700	00:46:34.720	the President to get this over as quickly as we
683	00:46:34.730	00:46:37.320	can and get these facts out. Well, if there remains
684	00:46:37.330	00:46:40.620	a hole, Senator Rudman, what is the question that describes
685	00:46:40.630	00:46:42.820	that hole? Or that points to it? In your mind,
686	00:46:42.830	00:46:45.700	what is the outstanding question? Well, obviously, we want to
687	00:46:45.710	00:46:48.500	get all the details on how the Iran arms sale
688	00:46:48.510	00:46:50.880	was put together at the level of the administration. That
689	00:46:50.890	00:46:52.660	is still not on the record very well, although we
690	00:46:52.670	00:46:55.340	have a pretty good idea. But we must get North
691	00:46:55.350	00:47:00.120	and Poindexter publicly to state in the most exquisite detail
692	00:47:00.130	00:47:02.740	of what they did, what they told the President, and
693	00:47:02.750	00:47:05.490	how they briefed the President, so that this President can
694	00:47:05.500	00:47:08.890	either get on with affairs of government or not. And
695	00:47:08.900	00:47:10.610	I happen to think the President--and I have said
696	00:47:10.620	00:47:16.110	consistently--knew nothing of the diversion of profits to the
697	00:47:16.120	00:47:18.550	Contras. But you know, what I think and what the
698	00:47:18.560	00:47:21.620	facts are can only be proven by people to testify.
699	00:47:21.630	00:47:23.600	And it's important we get that testimony. Which of course
700	00:47:23.610	00:47:26.850	is another reason why Judge Walsh--although I understand his
701	00:47:26.860	00:47:30.720	problem--must understand ours as well. I understand that. Thank
702	00:47:30.730	00:47:44.490	you, Senator Rudman, and Senator Inouye. Finally tonight, more about
703	00:47:44.500	00:47:48.290	AIDS. The third annual International Conference on the dreaded disease
704	00:47:48.300	00:47:50.970	is running this week in Washington, and each night we
705	00:47:50.980	00:47:53.990	are covering some aspect of it. Tonight, we have a
706	00:47:54.000	00:47:57.540	newsmaker interview with Dr. Jonathan Mann, Director of the AIDS
707	00:47:57.550	00:48:01.020	Program of the World Health Organization, one of the conference's
708	00:48:01.030	00:48:05.310	main sponsors. Dr. Mann, welcome. Thank you. How many people
709	00:48:05.320	00:48:09.040	in the world have AIDS right now? Well, there have
710	00:48:09.050	00:48:12.360	been a total of over 51,000 cases of AIDS reported
711	00:48:12.370	00:48:16.460	officially to the World Health Organization, from 113 countries around
712	00:48:16.470	00:48:19.760	the world. Now, we know that's an underestimate. The number
713	00:48:19.770	00:48:23.030	that's important to us is the 113. These are the
714	00:48:23.040	00:48:25.250	countries that have come forth with their report, and this
715	00:48:25.260	00:48:28.160	demonstrates the global scope of this problem. A hundred and
716	00:48:28.170	00:48:30.840	thirteen countries. Give me a feel for where they are,
717	00:48:30.850	00:48:33.550	what kind of countries they are. They're distributed all over
718	00:48:33.560	00:48:36.530	the world. Virtually all the countries of South America, Central
719	00:48:36.540	00:48:39.840	America and the Caribbean, of course North America, every country
720	00:48:39.850	00:48:43.550	in Europe, most of the countries in Africa, and several
721	00:48:43.560	00:48:46.630	countries in Asia, including some in the Middle East. Now,
722	00:48:46.640	00:48:51.730	of the 50,000+ cases, where are the majority of them,
723	00:48:51.740	00:48:54.090	is there any breakdown there in terms of parts of
724	00:48:54.100	00:48:56.900	the world? The majority of the cases actually have been
725	00:48:56.910	00:48:59.340	reported from the Americas. And they are the majority from
726	00:48:59.350	00:49:01.430	the United States. But that gets us right to the
727	00:49:01.440	00:49:03.920	point of whether the reported cases are the total of
728	00:49:03.930	00:49:06.470	cases. And that we know is not the case. We
729	00:49:06.480	00:49:08.240	know of at least a dozen countries that have not
730	00:49:08.250	00:49:11.600	yet officially reported cases to the World Health Organization. Why
731	00:49:11.610	00:49:14.500	not? Well, there's--it's a complicated issue. There are a
732	00:49:14.510	00:49:16.900	number of reasons. One reason is that in some cases,
733	00:49:16.910	00:49:20.650	they don't have the diagnostic capability, the laboratory capability, to
734	00:49:20.660	00:49:23.350	confirm the diagnosis. There are still some--Then how do
735	00:49:23.360	00:49:26.910	you know they've got cases they're not reporting? Well, in
736	00:49:26.920	00:49:29.970	some cases, they have the diagnostic capability, they know they
737	00:49:29.980	00:49:33.050	have cases, but there's still some political reluctance to talk
738	00:49:33.060	00:49:35.190	about it. And this is related to the wave of
739	00:49:35.200	00:49:38.960	stigmatization that we've seen around the world. People pointing fingers
740	00:49:38.970	00:49:41.850	and wanting to lay blame, all of which interferes with
741	00:49:41.860	00:49:44.700	the disease control effort. Is there a fear also of
742	00:49:44.710	00:49:48.490	panic among the population about it? Actually, most of the
743	00:49:48.500	00:49:52.240	countries in which AIDS has occurred, in those countries, there
744	00:49:52.250	00:49:55.270	is a discussion at the national level. People are aware
745	00:49:55.280	00:49:58.170	within the country. What we sometimes see, however, is a
746	00:49:58.180	00:50:01.720	reluctance to talk openly to the international press. That sometimes
747	00:50:01.730	00:50:03.650	can be related to tourism, it can be related to
748	00:50:03.660	00:50:07.570	other concerns as well. What kinds of countries are these
749	00:50:07.580	00:50:10.430	that are sitting on this kind of information? They include
750	00:50:10.440	00:50:13.980	countries in different parts of the world. But particularly in
751	00:50:13.990	00:50:18.360	Africa. In Africa, there's been a difficulty we've all experienced.
752	00:50:18.370	00:50:21.920	Because of the early hypotheses about the origins of the
753	00:50:21.930	00:50:25.730	disease and the stigmatization of Africans that has occurred, particularly
754	00:50:25.740	00:50:29.240	in Europe. And this has led to a reaction against
755	00:50:29.250	00:50:33.000	that, and a defensiveness. Fortunately, the World Health Organization has
756	00:50:33.010	00:50:35.410	been able to work with these countries. And we're working
757	00:50:35.420	00:50:39.130	already with 25 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, helping them build
758	00:50:39.140	00:50:42.100	their own strong national AIDS programs. What do you tell
759	00:50:42.110	00:50:45.720	them? What words do you use to tell the head
760	00:50:45.730	00:50:48.460	of a small country in Africa, "Tell the world that
761	00:50:48.470	00:50:50.940	you got an AIDS problem." What we do is we
762	00:50:50.950	00:50:54.260	say, "Let's work together. Let's collaborate. We know there's a
763	00:50:54.270	00:50:57.350	problem. Let's work together. We don't have a need to
764	00:50:57.360	00:50:59.820	broadcast this in any major way, but what we need
765	00:50:59.830	00:51:02.230	to do is start the work at the national level
766	00:51:02.240	00:51:04.680	that will bring the disease under control." And when that
767	00:51:04.690	00:51:09.750	happens the country then develops confidence, reports cases and that
768	00:51:09.760	00:51:13.060	is accomplished. You've used that expression a couple of times
769	00:51:13.070	00:51:16.360	now--bring the disease under control. What does that mean
770	00:51:16.370	00:51:19.700	at the state the disease is in right now? I
771	00:51:19.710	00:51:22.320	think even though we're facing--we do have a worldwide
772	00:51:22.330	00:51:26.070	epidemic of infection with the AIDS virus--we know what
773	00:51:26.080	00:51:28.640	we need to know to bring the disease under control.
774	00:51:28.650	00:51:31.700	We don't have to wait until there's a vaccine. We
775	00:51:31.710	00:51:34.190	know how it spreads. We know that it spreads because
776	00:51:34.200	00:51:37.420	of specific human behaviors which can be changed, which can
777	00:51:37.430	00:51:42.170	be modified. That's primarily sexual behavior and drug use, correct?
778	00:51:42.180	00:51:45.590	Well, that's true for--that's certainly true, but in addition,
779	00:51:45.600	00:51:48.780	we're talking about blood transfusions that are not yet screened
780	00:51:48.790	00:51:51.700	for safety in the developing world, and we're talking about
781	00:51:51.710	00:51:54.450	the reuse of other needles and syringes other than for
782	00:51:54.460	00:51:57.370	IV drug users in the developing world. And finally, of
783	00:51:57.380	00:51:59.660	course, the spread from mother to child. But it's basically
784	00:51:59.670	00:52:02.590	sexual spread throughout the world. Mother to child has become
785	00:52:02.600	00:52:05.760	a problem in many African nations, is that correct? Yes
786	00:52:05.770	00:52:09.410	it is, because in Africa the sexual spread is predominantly
787	00:52:09.420	00:52:12.920	heterosexual. Obviously, women who are pregnant can also be at
788	00:52:12.930	00:52:16.350	risk of being infected. And in some African cities, 10%
789	00:52:16.360	00:52:18.940	or more of pregnant women are already infected with the
790	00:52:18.950	00:52:23.230	virus. Say that again? Ten percent or more of women
791	00:52:23.240	00:52:26.840	in some African cities are already infected with the virus.
792	00:52:26.850	00:52:29.720	That is a stunning statistic. It is, and in fact,
793	00:52:29.730	00:52:34.560	it translates, unfortunately, into an infant mortality rate due to
794	00:52:34.570	00:52:37.600	AIDS in those counties that is greater than the total
795	00:52:37.610	00:52:41.630	infant mortality rate in the United States from all causes.
796	00:52:41.640	00:52:44.060	Is there any country in the world, Dr. Mann, that
797	00:52:44.070	00:52:46.930	you could cite as a good example of a country
798	00:52:46.940	00:52:50.200	that has recognized the AIDS problem, tackled it and done
799	00:52:50.210	00:52:54.900	something constructive to control it? Actually, there are several. There are
800	00:52:54.910	00:52:58.230	countries in Europe, such as the United Kingdom and Switzerland,
801	00:52:58.240	00:53:02.090	that have done an excellent job of informing their public
802	00:53:02.100	00:53:05.900	broadly about the problem. They've used mail drops, leaflets to
803	00:53:05.910	00:53:09.690	all households, and a variety of ways to inform people.
804	00:53:09.700	00:53:11.450	What do they say? Is it very blunt talk about
805	00:53:11.460	00:53:13.880	it? Is it about sexual behavior? What do they say?
806	00:53:13.890	00:53:17.440	It's as blunt as the society feels it can handle--
807	00:53:17.450	00:53:20.690	which varies from country to country. Sure. Another country that
808	00:53:20.700	00:53:22.790	needs to be cited in a very positive way is
809	00:53:22.800	00:53:26.140	Uganda. Uganda has a major AIDS problem, but it has
810	00:53:26.150	00:53:28.390	been open, and it has been clear both with the
811	00:53:28.400	00:53:32.480	international community and internally. And so they have their "Love
812	00:53:32.490	00:53:36.300	Carefully" campaign, which you hear about all over the country
813	00:53:36.310	00:53:39.940	of Uganda. We don't know yet what impact it's having,
814	00:53:39.950	00:53:43.380	but the openness and frankness must be paying off. Then,
815	00:53:43.390	00:53:46.450	of course, there are other countries like Australia, which has
816	00:53:46.460	00:53:50.120	a very well coordinated national program dealing very aggressively of
817	00:53:50.130	00:53:53.730	course with blood transfusions and educational programs and trying to
818	00:53:53.740	00:53:56.530	deal with that very difficult problem of intravenous drug users.
819	00:53:56.540	00:54:00.020	And are they actually having good results? Are they stopping
820	00:54:00.030	00:54:02.960	the spread of the disease? The best evidence we have
821	00:54:02.970	00:54:08.040	so far--direct evidence--comes from certain populations of gay
822	00:54:08.050	00:54:11.040	men. Gay men in certain cities in the United States
823	00:54:11.050	00:54:14.100	and in Europe, where it appears that the epidemic has
824	00:54:14.110	00:54:17.490	slowed. It has not yet stopped, but it has slowed.
825	00:54:17.500	00:54:19.960	The number of new infections seems to be on the
826	00:54:19.970	00:54:23.570	decline. Unfortunately, some people are still being infected. But this
827	00:54:23.580	00:54:25.390	is the best direct evidence. Now, if we look at
828	00:54:25.400	00:54:27.670	evidence in terms of knowledge--Excuse me. When you find
829	00:54:27.680	00:54:30.280	that--when you find that the disease has leveled off
830	00:54:30.290	00:54:32.160	somewhere, then are you able to go back and find
831	00:54:32.170	00:54:36.050	out why it leveled off? The best evidence we have
832	00:54:36.060	00:54:39.520	is that it's leveled off because of changes of behavior.
833	00:54:39.530	00:54:43.450	Brought on by fear or education--And education. Yes. Fear
834	00:54:43.460	00:54:47.140	by itself, of course, is useless. But education is clearly
835	00:54:47.150	00:54:50.410	the key. And fear can be a strong motivation. You
836	00:54:50.420	00:54:53.110	made a speech yesterday to the conference and you talked
837	00:54:53.120	00:54:56.860	about the third stage of the AIDS epidemic and the
838	00:54:56.870	00:55:01.100	cost and dislocation it's going to have on society. What
839	00:55:01.110	00:55:03.640	did you mean by that? To look at the whole
840	00:55:03.650	00:55:07.220	AIDS problem, we divided it into three phases. Three succeeding
841	00:55:07.230	00:55:10.520	waves of epidemics around the world. The first was the
842	00:55:10.530	00:55:13.610	epidemic of the virus itself, which was a silent epidemic
843	00:55:13.620	00:55:15.760	that began to spread worldwide in the mid to late
844	00:55:15.770	00:55:19.420	1970s. It's still going on, isn't it? Still going on.
845	00:55:19.430	00:55:22.020	We estimate five to ten million people are probably infected
846	00:55:22.030	00:55:24.800	now with the virus. The second epidemic is the epidemic
847	00:55:24.810	00:55:28.250	of the disease AIDS, which comes several years after the
848	00:55:28.260	00:55:30.890	epidemic of infection. Not all the five to ten million
849	00:55:30.900	00:55:32.750	are actually going to come down with AIDS, right? This
850	00:55:32.760	00:55:34.450	is the second stage you're talking about now. That's right.
851	00:55:34.460	00:55:37.820	We don't know what percentage ultimately will develop AIDS, but
852	00:55:37.830	00:55:40.740	we know that between ten and thirty percent will likely
853	00:55:40.750	00:55:43.150	develop AIDS in the next five years. So you have
854	00:55:43.160	00:55:46.800	a first epidemic of infection, then an epidemic of disease.
855	00:55:46.810	00:55:49.650	The third epidemic, which is also a worldwide epidemic, is
856	00:55:49.660	00:55:53.530	the epidemic of social reaction and response--to the economic
857	00:55:53.540	00:55:58.400	costs, social impact, the cultural impact, and the political impact.
858	00:55:58.410	00:56:01.160	Speaking of costs, I was told a few moments ago
859	00:56:01.170	00:56:03.170	that there is a new study out that shows that
860	00:56:03.180	00:56:08.860	by 1991, AIDS worldwide is going to cost $37 billion.
861	00:56:08.870	00:56:11.430	Well, I'm not sure of the source of the study.
862	00:56:11.440	00:56:13.700	And of course there are a lot of assumptions in
863	00:56:13.710	00:56:17.470	that kind of projection. But we're facing a billion dollar
864	00:56:17.480	00:56:21.280	level is clear. That we're facing in the next five
865	00:56:21.290	00:56:26.430	years probably between 500,000 and 3,000,000 new AIDS cases in
866	00:56:26.440	00:56:29.630	the world, coming from people already infected today with the
867	00:56:29.640	00:56:33.140	virus is clear. What that means and what that translates
868	00:56:33.150	00:56:36.240	to goes beyond the health statistics. It gets into the
869	00:56:36.250	00:56:39.220	economic costs, but also into the cultural and social and
870	00:56:39.230	00:56:43.300	political issues that we're seeing all over the world. That
871	00:56:43.310	00:56:45.760	study, by the way, was done by the Rand Corporation.
872	00:56:45.770	00:56:47.770	Are you familiar with that study? Not yet. I'm very
873	00:56:47.780	00:56:51.770	interested to hear it, because it actually blends--coincides rather
874	00:56:51.780	00:56:54.220	well with our own projections and with a statement I
875	00:56:54.230	00:56:56.150	made at the conference yesterday--which is that it will
876	00:56:56.160	00:56:59.550	cost billions of dollars in the next few years to
877	00:56:59.560	00:57:04.030	try to bring this worldwide emergency under control. And the
878	00:57:04.040	00:57:09.440	cost of that to society making a priority decision is
879	00:57:09.450	00:57:12.280	going also to be enormous, which is also your point.
880	00:57:12.290	00:57:15.010	It's very difficult, and in countries where the per capita
881	00:57:15.020	00:57:18.420	annual health budget is less than one dollar, we're talking
882	00:57:18.430	00:57:21.390	here about certain countries in Central Africa, the dilemmas are
883	00:57:21.400	00:57:25.430	extraordinarily acute and they will need help. Dr. Mann, thank
884	00:57:25.440	00:57:27.900	you very much. Again, good luck to you and your
885	00:57:27.910	00:57:38.840	efforts. Again, the major stories this Wednesday, businessman Albert Hakim
886	00:57:38.850	00:57:43.310	told the Iran-Contra committees he set aside $200,000 in profits
887	00:57:43.320	00:57:47.090	from the Iran arms sales for Oliver North's children. Several
888	00:57:47.100	00:57:50.560	Democrats on the committee suggested Assistant Secretary of State Elliott
889	00:57:50.570	00:57:54.510	Abrams might have to step down. Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh
890	00:57:54.520	00:57:57.900	asked the committees to deny immunity to Col. North. But
891	00:57:57.910	00:58:00.630	on the NewsHour the Chairman and Co-Chairman of the Senate
892	00:58:00.640	00:58:04.170	Committee, Senators Daniel Inouye and Warren Rudman, said they have
893	00:58:04.180	00:58:07.920	to have North's testimony. Good night, Jim. Good night, Robin.
894	00:58:07.930	00:58:09.910	We'll see you tomorrow night. I'm Jim Lehrer. Thank you
895	00:58:09.920	00:58:57.422	and good night.
