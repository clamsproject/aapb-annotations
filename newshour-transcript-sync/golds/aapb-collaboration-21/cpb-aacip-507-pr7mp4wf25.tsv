1	00:01:44.320	00:01:47.610	Good evening, I'm Jim Lehrer. On the NewsHour tonight, excerpts
2	00:01:47.620	00:01:51.340	from last night's Republican candidate forum in New Hampshire, with
3	00:01:51.350	00:01:55.670	analysis by Tom Oliphant and David Brooks, substituting for Mark
4	00:01:55.680	00:01:58.810	Shields and Paul Gigot; a Terence Smith look at the
5	00:01:58.820	00:02:01.460	opening of a new front in the TV morning news
6	00:02:01.470	00:02:05.080	war; and a Ray Suarez conversation with the new president
7	00:02:05.090	00:02:08.390	of Nigeria. It all follows our summary of the news
8	00:02:08.400	00:02:50.630	this Friday. President Clinton today proposed new rules to protect
9	00:02:50.640	00:02:54.820	patients' privacy. They'd be the first federal regulations designed to
10	00:02:54.830	00:02:59.370	keep computerized medical records confidential. They'd prevent the release of
11	00:02:59.380	00:03:04.230	sensitive files to employers, marketers, and others without patient consent.
12	00:03:04.240	00:03:07.090	They'd also allow patients to see who has viewed the
13	00:03:07.100	00:03:11.260	material and take legal action against anyone who abuses it.
14	00:03:11.270	00:03:15.400	The President spoke at the White House. Today with a click
15	00:03:15.410	00:03:18.800	of a mouse personal health information can easily and now
16	00:03:18.810	00:03:23.020	legally be passed around without patients' consent to people who
17	00:03:23.030	00:03:26.480	aren't doctors, for reasons that have nothing to do with
18	00:03:26.490	00:03:29.890	health care. Americans should never have to worry that their
19	00:03:29.900	00:03:35.470	employers are looking at the medications they take or the
20	00:03:35.480	00:03:40.020	ailments they've had. In 1999, Americans should never have to
21	00:03:40.030	00:03:46.330	worry about nightmare scenarios depicted in George Orwell's "1984." The
22	00:03:46.340	00:03:49.220	new privacy rules would go into effect in the year
23	00:03:49.230	00:03:54.540	2002 following public review. On Wall Street today, the stock
24	00:03:54.550	00:03:58.280	market kept climbing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up
25	00:03:58.290	00:04:04.060	107 points at 10,729; the NASDAQ Index was up 91
26	00:04:04.070	00:04:08.100	points and closed at a record 2,966. It was an
27	00:04:08.110	00:04:12.600	apparent continuation of a rally started yesterday on government reports
28	00:04:12.610	00:04:16.360	of steady growth and low inflation in the third quarter.
29	00:04:16.370	00:04:19.510	The Senate today shelved a bill extending new trade privileges
30	00:04:19.520	00:04:22.570	to countries in Africa and the Caribbean. It would have
31	00:04:22.580	00:04:27.480	lowered tariffs and quotas on imports. Senators from textile-producing states
32	00:04:27.490	00:04:29.960	voted against it. Trade will be one of the issues
33	00:04:29.970	00:04:33.630	addressed during an interview with the president of Nigeria later
34	00:04:33.640	00:04:38.380	in our program tonight. Russia rejected international calls for diplomacy
35	00:04:38.390	00:04:41.690	and launched a new wave of attacks on Chechnya today.
36	00:04:41.700	00:04:45.240	Russian air force and artillery pounded the capital Grozny and
37	00:04:45.250	00:04:49.780	several villages. Troops blocked off border crossings, stranding thousands of
38	00:04:49.790	00:04:54.440	refugees. In Moscow, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
39	00:04:54.450	00:04:57.970	met with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov. He spoke about the
40	00:04:57.980	00:05:04.200	situation. We understand that Russia is grappling with a very
41	00:05:04.210	00:05:10.250	real and very grave threat in the form of extremism
42	00:05:10.260	00:05:15.170	and terrorism, and that obviously the Russian federation has not
43	00:05:15.180	00:05:19.810	just a right, but an obligation to protect the Russian
44	00:05:19.820	00:05:25.500	state and protect Russian citizens. It's the hope of the
45	00:05:25.510	00:05:27.750	United States, and I think many others in the international
46	00:05:27.760	00:05:33.000	community, that Russia will find a way of addressing this
47	00:05:33.010	00:05:37.290	extremely serious challenge in a way that minimizes as much
48	00:05:37.300	00:05:42.620	as possible a civilian casualties, the loss of innocent lives.
49	00:05:42.630	00:05:45.840	Back in this country today, a plot to kill people
50	00:05:45.850	00:05:49.260	at a Cleveland high school using guns and explosives was
51	00:05:49.270	00:05:53.750	uncovered. Authorities closed the school. Mayor Michael White said four
52	00:05:53.760	00:05:57.490	students had been arrested and were being held in custody.
53	00:05:57.500	00:06:00.710	The "Cleveland Plain Dealer" newspaper reported the plan was similar
54	00:06:00.720	00:06:03.700	to the one carried out earlier this year at Columbine
55	00:06:03.710	00:06:07.330	High School in Colorado. Fifteen people were killed in that
56	00:06:07.340	00:06:11.900	attack. Republican presidential candidates faced off in New Hampshire last
57	00:06:11.910	00:06:14.910	night. They took part in a town meeting-style debate at
58	00:06:14.920	00:06:19.080	Dartmouth College. Absent was Texas Governor George W. Bush. The
59	00:06:19.090	00:06:22.720	five others answered questions on issues such as taxes and
60	00:06:22.730	00:06:26.810	abortion. We'll have excerpts right after this News Summary. Rhode
61	00:06:26.820	00:06:30.820	Islanders paid their last respects to Senator John Chafee today.
62	00:06:30.830	00:06:33.490	Chafee's body lay in state in the rotunda of the
63	00:06:33.500	00:06:37.840	capitol building in providence. The 77-year-old Republican died of heart
64	00:06:37.850	00:06:41.900	failure on Sunday. President Clinton, cabinet members, and members of
65	00:06:41.910	00:06:46.140	Congress plan to attend a memorial service for Chafee tomorrow.
66	00:06:46.150	00:06:49.100	There was a memorial service for golfer Payne Stewart today
67	00:06:49.110	00:06:52.490	in Orlando. He and five others were killed Monday when
68	00:06:52.500	00:06:56.390	their Learjet mysteriously veered off course and crashed in South
69	00:06:56.400	00:07:00.340	Dakota. Golfers Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara were among those
70	00:07:00.350	00:07:05.100	who attended today's service. Two professional golf tournaments postponed action
71	00:07:05.110	00:07:09.550	so Stewart's colleagues could attend. The chief investigator into the
72	00:07:09.560	00:07:13.090	crash said today the Learjet was traveling 600 miles an
73	00:07:13.100	00:07:15.740	hour when it hit the ground. He based that on
74	00:07:15.750	00:07:19.400	the condition of the cockpit voice recorder. Millions of New
75	00:07:19.410	00:07:22.360	York Yankee fans lined Broadway today to cheer their World
76	00:07:22.370	00:07:26.270	Series champs through the city's canyon of heroes. The team
77	00:07:26.280	00:07:30.820	was given a traditional ticker tape parade, riding on half-a-dozen,
78	00:07:30.830	00:07:34.720	specially designed floats. A rally at city hall wrapped up the
79	00:07:34.730	00:07:38.990	day's festivities. The Yankees clinched a record 25th World Series
80	00:07:39.000	00:07:42.470	title on Wednesday. And that's it for the News Summary
81	00:07:42.480	00:07:45.660	tonight. Now it's on to the Republicans in New Hampshire,
82	00:07:45.670	00:07:49.280	analysis by Oliphant and Brooks, the new front in the
83	00:07:49.290	00:08:01.480	morning news wars, and the new president of Nigeria. Last
84	00:08:01.490	00:08:04.970	night we had the Democratic presidential candidates in action. Tonight,
85	00:08:04.980	00:08:07.850	it's the Republicans. Five of them were on stage last
86	00:08:07.860	00:08:11.830	night in a town meeting format at Dartmouth College in
87	00:08:11.840	00:08:15.230	Hanover, New Hampshire. Texas Governor George W. Bush did not
88	00:08:15.240	00:08:19.990	participate. Here are excerpts from the event. Good evening, and
89	00:08:20.000	00:08:21.960	thank you all very much for joining us here in
90	00:08:21.970	00:08:26.310	New Hampshire tonight. Let's begin with our first question. Should
91	00:08:26.320	00:08:32.050	the Republican Party be more inclusive by encouraging pro-choice voters
92	00:08:32.060	00:08:35.920	to support their candidates? I worry a great deal about
93	00:08:35.930	00:08:39.680	the unintended consequences of sending a message that we are
94	00:08:39.690	00:08:43.750	not an inclusionary party. I am a proud pro-life person.
95	00:08:43.760	00:08:48.020	I have a 17-year record on that issue. But I
96	00:08:48.030	00:08:52.180	believe that we must begin a dialogue and a discussion
97	00:08:52.190	00:08:56.860	on the issue of abortion. Both pro-life and pro-choice people
98	00:08:56.870	00:09:00.300	believe very strongly that we need to eliminate abortion. I
99	00:09:00.310	00:09:03.520	and my wife, Cindy, are proud adoptive parents. We need
100	00:09:03.530	00:09:06.170	to encourage adoption in America. We need to match up
101	00:09:06.180	00:09:08.900	those children that have no families with those families that
102	00:09:08.910	00:09:12.280	have no children. We need to improve foster care dramatically
103	00:09:12.290	00:09:16.940	in America. We can work together. And my party, which
104	00:09:16.950	00:09:19.800	is proud of its pro-life position and I am proud
105	00:09:19.810	00:09:23.380	of it, should send the word, we want you in
106	00:09:23.390	00:09:27.810	our party. We can have respectful disagreements on specific issues
107	00:09:27.820	00:09:30.240	and we can work together on this one. I thank
108	00:09:30.250	00:09:36.670	you. Thank you, Senator. I'd like to hear the Senator's
109	00:09:36.680	00:09:41.110	position on Second Amendment rights, and if elected, what his
110	00:09:41.120	00:09:45.020	policy would be toward the recent wave of litigation facing
111	00:09:45.030	00:09:48.050	the firearms industry. Well let me tell you something. When
112	00:09:48.060	00:09:53.000	it comes to constitutional...expressed constitutional provisions--and the second
113	00:09:53.010	00:09:55.710	amendment is one of those expressed provisions--you've got to
114	00:09:55.720	00:09:59.940	be very loathe to try and change that provision by
115	00:09:59.950	00:10:02.740	mere statute. So I am a strong supporter of Second
116	00:10:02.750	00:10:06.490	Amendment rights. I am also a strong criticizer of this
117	00:10:06.500	00:10:10.320	administration, because there are people being killed in our society
118	00:10:10.330	00:10:13.870	today because they're not enforcing the law. Parents are afraid
119	00:10:13.880	00:10:15.680	to have their kids go to school because they don't
120	00:10:15.690	00:10:17.800	know whether those kids are going to be safe in
121	00:10:17.810	00:10:21.230	schools. They're worried to death about it. And the reason
122	00:10:21.240	00:10:26.060	they are is because 12,000 kids and adults took guns
123	00:10:26.070	00:10:28.960	to school in the last two years in violation of
124	00:10:28.970	00:10:33.820	law. Guess how many prosecutions by this administration? Thirteen. I'll
125	00:10:33.830	00:10:35.970	tell you what I'd do. If you commit a crime
126	00:10:35.980	00:10:37.050	with the use of a gun and you have a
127	00:10:37.060	00:10:40.600	gun on you, it's an automatic ten years without parole.
128	00:10:40.610	00:10:43.800	If you fire that gun, it's an automatic 20 years.
129	00:10:43.810	00:10:46.950	If you hurt somebody with that gun, it's an automatic
130	00:10:46.960	00:10:50.560	life. How do you plan to continue with the war
131	00:10:50.570	00:10:55.240	on drugs? When I was born in 1950, we didn't
132	00:10:55.250	00:10:59.090	have a huge plethora of laws dealing with all kinds
133	00:10:59.100	00:11:02.250	of drug use and abuse, and yet we also did
134	00:11:02.260	00:11:05.650	not have an enormous drug problem in this country. The
135	00:11:05.660	00:11:09.550	reason that we proliferated the laws is because the fundamental
136	00:11:09.560	00:11:13.510	discipline that was prevailing in our society when I was
137	00:11:13.520	00:11:17.880	born has broken down. We have a crisis that goes
138	00:11:17.890	00:11:20.500	to the heart of the question of whether or not
139	00:11:20.510	00:11:23.020	we're a people that still acknowledges that there is a
140	00:11:23.030	00:11:26.030	difference between right and wrong which we must pass on
141	00:11:26.040	00:11:29.020	to our children and enforce, even if it means that
142	00:11:29.030	00:11:31.570	we ourselves must accept inconvenience. Thank you, Mr. Keyes. When
143	00:11:31.580	00:11:33.810	we face that reality, then we will have solved the
144	00:11:33.820	00:11:44.710	problem. I would like to know whether you would want
145	00:11:44.720	00:11:48.120	to change the immigration quotas: Increase them, decrease them, leave
146	00:11:48.130	00:11:50.930	them the same? I think back of my time in
147	00:11:50.940	00:11:53.110	Newport, Kentucky, when I was growing up. It was a
148	00:11:53.120	00:11:56.660	tough, blue-collar town, and I remember in elementary school we
149	00:11:56.670	00:11:59.250	would all stand in line to get milk. And then
150	00:11:59.260	00:12:01.210	the school bully would come along and get in the
151	00:12:01.220	00:12:03.920	front of the line and nobody could do anything about
152	00:12:03.930	00:12:06.610	it because he was bigger than anybody else. Well, we
153	00:12:06.620	00:12:09.660	have millions of people around the world that are standing
154	00:12:09.670	00:12:12.910	in line to get into the United States. They see
155	00:12:12.920	00:12:15.910	it as that shining city on a hill that the
156	00:12:15.920	00:12:18.950	Founding Fathers talked about and that Ronald Reagan reminded us
157	00:12:18.960	00:12:21.920	of all the time. They're playing by the rules, they're
158	00:12:21.930	00:12:26.500	abiding by the law, and we allow countless people to
159	00:12:26.510	00:12:29.560	butt into the front of the line, to pour across
160	00:12:29.570	00:12:33.080	our borders and have as their first act as entering
161	00:12:33.090	00:12:37.510	our country the violation of our laws. We must secure
162	00:12:37.520	00:12:40.140	our border. A great nation should not have borders that
163	00:12:40.150	00:12:43.220	are unsecured; and I believe if we do that, then
164	00:12:43.230	00:12:45.620	we can make a judgment as a people what the
165	00:12:45.630	00:12:49.930	appropriate legal immigration levels ought to be. I'd really like
166	00:12:49.940	00:12:52.190	to be able to ask this to the candidate who's
167	00:12:52.200	00:12:56.700	not here but I can't do that. Mr. Forbes, as
168	00:12:56.710	00:13:00.270	nominee of the Republican Party or as President, what would
169	00:13:00.280	00:13:04.790	you do to keep the future nominations from being bought?
170	00:13:04.800	00:13:07.790	Like you, I share the frustration that Governor Bush is
171	00:13:07.800	00:13:10.760	not here tonight. He didn't come to a debate last
172	00:13:10.770	00:13:13.370	week because he had a fundraiser. A couple of weeks
173	00:13:13.380	00:13:16.040	ago, his plane got delayed. He had a choice between
174	00:13:16.050	00:13:19.170	a fundraiser and going to a school in Rhode Island
175	00:13:19.180	00:13:23.350	with underprivileged kids. He chose the fundraiser. So perhaps in
176	00:13:23.360	00:13:25.170	the future at a forum like this--if we call
177	00:13:25.180	00:13:30.100	it a fundraiser--he might show up. But seriously, to
178	00:13:30.110	00:13:33.460	get to your question, we should have a system in
179	00:13:33.470	00:13:37.640	America where individuals can give as much as they want
180	00:13:37.650	00:13:40.560	to a candidate as long as there is full and
181	00:13:40.570	00:13:44.990	prompt disclosure. The establishment loves these current rules because, unless
182	00:13:45.000	00:13:48.200	you are blest like me with independent resources, they have
183	00:13:48.210	00:13:52.850	ways of shutting you out and all 67,000 lobbyists in
184	00:13:52.860	00:13:56.460	Washington--they have all rallied around Governor Bush; they want
185	00:13:56.470	00:14:01.390	a coronation, not a real contest, and that's fundamentally wrong.
186	00:14:01.400	00:14:03.230	We want to ask each of you, do you favor
187	00:14:03.240	00:14:07.070	a flat tax? If so, at exactly what rate? And
188	00:14:07.080	00:14:10.870	I'm going to begin on the left with Senator Hatch.
189	00:14:10.880	00:14:13.680	Well, naturally, I favor throwing out the current system and
190	00:14:13.690	00:14:16.560	getting rid of this awful IRS Code. In fact, if
191	00:14:16.570	00:14:18.240	I had my way, we'd get rid of the IRS
192	00:14:18.250	00:14:21.720	and come up with the most fair, simple, decent, honorable
193	00:14:21.730	00:14:24.020	system we can have. But I'll tell you something, I worry
194	00:14:24.030	00:14:25.920	about a flat tax because I'm on the Senate Finance
195	00:14:25.930	00:14:29.580	Committee. And I can tell you, we spend a lot
196	00:14:29.590	00:14:31.700	of time just figuring out where all these little things
197	00:14:31.710	00:14:36.300	go. And it's just a natural propensity in Congress to
198	00:14:36.310	00:14:38.350	see us add more and more to that tax code
199	00:14:38.360	00:14:42.450	until we satisfy just about every citizen in America. And
200	00:14:42.460	00:14:45.030	it's killing our country. Sure I'm for a flat tax.
201	00:14:45.040	00:14:47.450	I'm for a tax system where average Americans can fill
202	00:14:47.460	00:14:50.260	out their taxes on a postcard and send it in,
203	00:14:50.270	00:14:52.370	and not have the fear of an audit. But, my
204	00:14:52.380	00:14:54.750	dear friends, do you know why the tax code is
205	00:14:54.760	00:14:59.490	44,000 pages long? Do you know why it's a nightmare,
206	00:14:59.500	00:15:02.510	a chamber of horrors for average citizens and a cornucopia
207	00:15:02.520	00:15:06.120	of good deals for the special interests? The special interests
208	00:15:06.130	00:15:09.440	rule in Washington. The big money, the huge six and
209	00:15:09.450	00:15:13.030	seven-figure contributions that come in, that every time we pass
210	00:15:13.040	00:15:16.120	a tax bill we add another special loophole and a
211	00:15:16.130	00:15:19.700	special deal for the special interests. I'm for reform. I'm
212	00:15:19.710	00:15:22.670	for reform of education, reforming the military, reforming the tax
213	00:15:22.680	00:15:27.260	code. My dear friends, that's not possible. That's not possible
214	00:15:27.270	00:15:31.280	when average Americans are no longer represented in Washington, DC.
215	00:15:31.290	00:15:35.180	And I will fight to the last breath I draw
216	00:15:35.190	00:15:37.900	to eliminate the influence of special interests in the tax
217	00:15:37.910	00:15:40.780	code and every other part of America, and I will
218	00:15:40.790	00:15:44.490	not rest until I give the government back to you.
219	00:15:44.500	00:15:55.300	Thank you. Ambassador Keyes. The income tax is a form
220	00:15:55.310	00:15:58.120	of taxation that was advocated by Marx and Lenin because
221	00:15:58.130	00:16:02.040	it cedes, in principle, to the government control of every
222	00:16:02.050	00:16:05.640	last dollar that is made or earned in the economy.
223	00:16:05.650	00:16:08.080	Think about it. And this country was not founded with
224	00:16:08.090	00:16:12.300	an income tax. The founders put in the Constitution provisions
225	00:16:12.310	00:16:15.650	that made an income tax unconstitutional--a direct tax on
226	00:16:15.660	00:16:18.670	our people, government dipping directly into our pocket to spend
227	00:16:18.680	00:16:21.360	our money before we get a chance to say anything
228	00:16:21.370	00:16:23.700	about it. The issue isn't the tax rate and the
229	00:16:23.710	00:16:26.210	issue isn't whether it's flat or progressive. The issue is
230	00:16:26.220	00:16:30.310	the income tax itself. I am an abolitionist; shouldn't surprise
231	00:16:30.320	00:16:33.690	you. I think that just as we had to get
232	00:16:33.700	00:16:36.700	rid of chattel slavery in the last century, we need
233	00:16:36.710	00:16:38.740	to get rid of tax slavery at the end of
234	00:16:38.750	00:16:41.750	the 20th century so our children in the 21st will
235	00:16:41.760	00:16:45.290	have control of every last dollar they earn. And the
236	00:16:45.300	00:16:48.000	government won't get a say in what is done with
237	00:16:48.010	00:16:51.130	that money until after they deal with it and then,
238	00:16:51.140	00:16:54.110	in the open marketplace, you put a sales tax on
239	00:16:54.120	00:17:02.930	transactions in that marketplace. Ambassador Keyes, thank you very much.
240	00:17:02.940	00:17:06.300	Mr. Bauer. I grew up in a home where my
241	00:17:06.310	00:17:10.230	father was a janitor. I'm used to having bills last
242	00:17:10.240	00:17:13.890	till Friday when the paycheck only lasted till Thursday. And
243	00:17:13.900	00:17:17.660	so my flat tax proposal recognizes that the real wealth
244	00:17:17.670	00:17:20.930	of America is in our families. I have a 16
245	00:17:20.940	00:17:24.260	percent across-the-board rate. You would be able to keep your
246	00:17:24.270	00:17:28.610	mortgage deduction and your charitable deduction. And everybody would pay
247	00:17:28.620	00:17:33.880	the 16 percent: The waitress and the corporation. Now, Steve
248	00:17:33.890	00:17:36.770	has a plan that he'll elaborate on. But Steve has
249	00:17:36.780	00:17:41.420	a major new write-off in his plan for big business.
250	00:17:41.430	00:17:44.280	He allows the big corporations to write off the entire
251	00:17:44.290	00:17:46.970	cost of their investments in the year that they make
252	00:17:46.980	00:17:50.950	them. Well, this is a delightful evening...because when I
253	00:17:50.960	00:17:56.740	ran four years ago, virtually every Republican denounced the idea
254	00:17:56.750	00:18:02.670	of a flat tax. So education works. Some are slower
255	00:18:02.680	00:18:07.470	than others, but they're coming along. Now, Gary, you are
256	00:18:07.480	00:18:11.120	wrong. I give generous deductions and exemptions to each adult
257	00:18:11.130	00:18:13.860	and each child. A family of four, a family of
258	00:18:13.870	00:18:16.650	four, such as the Daley family in Exeter, New Hampshire,
259	00:18:16.660	00:18:21.130	their first $41,000 of income is free of federal income
260	00:18:21.140	00:18:25.660	tax; above the $41,000 level for the Daley family, only
261	00:18:25.670	00:18:30.070	17 cents on the dollar above $41,000; no tax on
262	00:18:30.080	00:18:35.190	pensions; no tax on capital gains; and no death taxes.
263	00:18:35.200	00:18:37.470	You'll be allowed to leave the world unmolested by the
264	00:18:37.480	00:18:42.220	IRS...sort of a new principle of taxation...no taxation
265	00:18:42.230	00:18:49.620	without respiration. And as a businessman, as a businessman, I
266	00:18:49.630	00:18:53.300	have incentives for investment. If you tell a farmer you
267	00:18:53.310	00:18:56.370	can't recover the cost of your tractor, you ruin him.
268	00:18:56.380	00:18:59.030	You tell a restaurant owner they can't recover the cost
269	00:18:59.040	00:19:02.550	of the equipment, you ruin them. I provide for jobs.
270	00:19:02.560	00:19:04.800	I provide a tax break for all. And I'm glad
271	00:19:04.810	00:19:10.680	they're coming on board. Mr. Forbes, thank you very much.
272	00:19:10.690	00:19:22.230	That's it. Thanks to Dartmouth and to all of you.
273	00:19:22.240	00:19:25.570	Now, analysis of last night's Republican event as well as
274	00:19:25.580	00:19:28.620	the Democrats' on Wednesday night. We get it from "Boston
275	00:19:28.630	00:19:32.540	Globe" columnist Tom Oliphant, and David Brooks, senior editor at
276	00:19:32.550	00:19:35.450	the "Weekly Standard." Mark Shields and Paul Gigot are both
277	00:19:35.460	00:19:39.620	off tonight. First, last night's Republican event. Tom, what struck
278	00:19:39.630	00:19:43.250	you as the most important thing that happened? The most...
279	00:19:43.260	00:19:46.540	leaving Bush aside, for a second, leaving Governor Bush aside,
280	00:19:46.550	00:19:51.160	John McCain has gone to ground in New Hampshire for
281	00:19:51.170	00:19:55.500	the last month. Traveling all over the state, pushing very
282	00:19:55.510	00:19:59.030	hard--a different version of what he's been saying in
283	00:19:59.040	00:20:02.920	the last several months; namely, that reform can be a
284	00:20:02.930	00:20:07.940	conservative word. And people saw it last night I think
285	00:20:07.950	00:20:10.390	in a larger audience for the first time and also
286	00:20:10.400	00:20:14.350	saw somebody really working for it now. McCain is sometimes
287	00:20:14.360	00:20:17.810	a laidback figure. But on Thursday night he was a
288	00:20:17.820	00:20:21.630	wired figure. He was working for it. And I think
289	00:20:21.640	00:20:24.120	after it was all over, most of the talk was
290	00:20:24.130	00:20:26.640	about him. You agree, David? Yes. I think it was.
291	00:20:26.650	00:20:28.140	I would say the most important thing was that George
292	00:20:28.150	00:20:30.590	W. slept in his bed in Austin and didn't come
293	00:20:30.600	00:20:32.750	up there, because there are two things the Republicans want
294	00:20:32.760	00:20:35.280	answered from the debates. The first one is how lightweight
295	00:20:35.290	00:20:37.730	is George W. Bush? Can he take the pressure? He
296	00:20:37.740	00:20:39.710	wasn't there to answer that question. The second is something
297	00:20:39.720	00:20:42.340	Tom referred to, which is that John McCain and George
298	00:20:42.350	00:20:44.520	Bush too are trying to move the party away from
299	00:20:44.530	00:20:47.610	Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey and Barry Goldwater-that whole
300	00:20:47.620	00:20:50.850	movement of conservatism which was an antigovernment movement-that's something
301	00:20:50.860	00:20:53.800	McCain and Bush are moving away from. What they talk
302	00:20:53.810	00:20:56.630	about is limited but energetic government. They talk about using
303	00:20:56.640	00:20:59.210	government in an affirmative way and a conservative way. They
304	00:20:59.220	00:21:02.400	talk about restoring faith in public service. What they're doing
305	00:21:02.410	00:21:05.550	is they're going back to a Teddy Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln
306	00:21:05.560	00:21:09.030	style of Republicanism. Teddy Roosevelt said I'm the hero of
307	00:21:09.040	00:21:11.410	San Juan Hill; only you can trust me to reform
308	00:21:11.420	00:21:14.030	government, to take on those special interests. Well, who's saying
309	00:21:14.040	00:21:17.600	that today? That's John McCain. So-just if I could finish,
310	00:21:17.610	00:21:20.330	Steve Forbes came to the debate yesterday armed to the
311	00:21:20.340	00:21:22.170	teeth to take this on. He was going to call
312	00:21:22.180	00:21:25.880	it tax-and-spend conservatism. But because Bush wasn't there and because
313	00:21:25.890	00:21:27.650	the way the questions were asked, he didn't get a
314	00:21:27.660	00:21:30.060	chance to launch that argument but it's an argument the
315	00:21:30.070	00:21:34.360	Republican Party has to have. Indeed before the debate, the
316	00:21:34.370	00:21:37.340	many people who are well paid by the Forbes campaign
317	00:21:37.350	00:21:43.150	were circulating these rather large tomes documenting sins of spending
318	00:21:43.160	00:21:49.380	and taxation by Governor Bush...In Texas? Yes, as governor.
319	00:21:49.390	00:21:54.260	And then just not delivered. Whereas McCain came to that
320	00:21:54.270	00:21:58.880	debate armed with stuff he was going to put out,
321	00:21:58.890	00:22:01.800	which he then did. And I was struck, not just
322	00:22:01.810	00:22:04.140	by him, but by some of the others about how
323	00:22:04.150	00:22:09.390	thoroughly put together their campaigns are intellectually at this point.
324	00:22:09.400	00:22:11.680	And that is a distinction with Governor Bush, I would
325	00:22:11.690	00:22:14.840	argue at this point. What do you mean, Tom? Well,
326	00:22:14.850	00:22:17.670	McCain on taxes I think would be a good example
327	00:22:17.680	00:22:20.930	last night. He's saying, look, that thing that passed Congress
328	00:22:20.940	00:22:24.770	and Clinton vetoed a month or two ago, half of
329	00:22:24.780	00:22:29.990	it was just special interest garbage that weighed it down.
330	00:22:30.000	00:22:33.200	If you have real reform, you won't have those special
331	00:22:33.210	00:22:37.010	interest goodies in a tax cut bill; you'll have rate
332	00:22:37.020	00:22:40.310	cuts for people. That was his message. Reform can work
333	00:22:40.320	00:22:44.030	for conservatives. Governor Bush is still a ways away from
334	00:22:44.040	00:22:46.470	even having a position on taxes. I'm not sure I
335	00:22:46.480	00:22:48.330	agree with that. I think he has given speeches which
336	00:22:48.340	00:22:51.890	were tremendously effective and intellectually coherent, Governor Bush. What he
337	00:22:51.900	00:22:55.220	said he-I stand for governing conservatism--not the opposition
338	00:22:55.230	00:22:57.980	conservatism of Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey, not the no,
339	00:22:57.990	00:23:01.900	no, no. He said I stand for using government. He
340	00:23:01.910	00:23:03.550	and McCain both say that, but they say it in
341	00:23:03.560	00:23:08.000	different spheres. Bush is more comfortable talking about education, charity,
342	00:23:08.010	00:23:11.930	poverty programs, using government very specifically in those areas. McCain
343	00:23:11.940	00:23:14.550	is less comfortable talking about that; he's more comfortable talking
344	00:23:14.560	00:23:18.370	about national reform, international activism. What about the fight that's
345	00:23:18.380	00:23:21.500	going on to the right of those two men, essentially
346	00:23:21.510	00:23:24.890	between Forbes and Bauer at this point? How did that
347	00:23:24.900	00:23:28.220	appearance last night affect that, do you think? Well, the
348	00:23:28.230	00:23:30.600	amazing thing, the first...let's talk about the context. This
349	00:23:30.610	00:23:32.550	was a party run by the conservative movement, by the
350	00:23:32.560	00:23:36.070	Goldwaterites three years ago. The two major candidates, the two
351	00:23:36.080	00:23:38.710	top contenders are not in that tradition-McCain and Bush
352	00:23:38.720	00:23:42.090	are not in that Goldwater tradition. Bauer and Forbes are
353	00:23:42.100	00:23:43.890	fighting for that tradition. And I would say on the
354	00:23:43.900	00:23:47.660	conservative buzz over the past year, over the past few
355	00:23:47.670	00:23:50.480	weeks, has been the fall of Steve Forbes. He's been
356	00:23:50.490	00:23:53.500	running for office for five years. He spent $60 million.
357	00:23:53.510	00:23:56.310	He's at 4 percent nationally, he's almost nowhere in New
358	00:23:56.320	00:24:00.410	Hampshire. He's slightly above Bauer and Keyes and Hatch, and
359	00:24:00.420	00:24:02.390	so they're fighting over what is turning out to be
360	00:24:02.400	00:24:04.720	a small rump. And I think Bauer is doing quite
361	00:24:04.730	00:24:07.970	a good job in part because Forbes is bleeding--just
362	00:24:07.980	00:24:10.480	interest among his true believers is bleeding. There is a
363	00:24:10.490	00:24:14.680	substantive element, I think, to it as well. Bauer's economic
364	00:24:14.690	00:24:18.650	version of flat tax is a little bit more populist,
365	00:24:18.660	00:24:21.870	a little bit more aimed downscale. You could almost sense
366	00:24:21.880	00:24:25.850	last night him aiming for what's left of the Pat
367	00:24:25.860	00:24:30.260	Buchanan vote in 1996. Listen to what he said on
368	00:24:30.270	00:24:34.750	education...immigration rather-That is a Pat Buchanan issue. Indeed,
369	00:24:34.760	00:24:38.980	very much so. But it's at the margins and you
370	00:24:38.990	00:24:43.260	can feel it there. There is this incredible prosperity in
371	00:24:43.270	00:24:46.270	New Hampshire. This is not an angry state the way
372	00:24:46.280	00:24:48.840	it was eight years ago. And I think the politics
373	00:24:48.850	00:24:52.170	on the Republican side reflects that. Speaking in pure political
374	00:24:52.180	00:24:54.880	terms now, what does the fact that George W. Bush
375	00:24:54.890	00:24:57.170	was not there last night, what does that mean and
376	00:24:57.180	00:24:58.880	how does that hurt Bush, if at all? Well, this
377	00:24:58.890	00:25:01.450	is the third or fourth element running in a story
378	00:25:01.460	00:25:04.880	running for four weeks now. You don't come here enough.
379	00:25:04.890	00:25:06.740	They say that in Iowa too; when you come, you
380	00:25:06.750	00:25:11.100	don't say much. Your positions aren't that fleshed out in
381	00:25:11.110	00:25:14.690	the sense that they make sense to an individual voter.
382	00:25:14.700	00:25:18.560	And you got to start working for it. Now he
383	00:25:18.570	00:25:21.510	can change all that in a New York minute. But
384	00:25:21.520	00:25:24.580	there has been...A New Hampshire minute. New Hampshire minute,
385	00:25:24.590	00:25:28.170	it takes longer. That's about 95 seconds, I think, the
386	00:25:28.180	00:25:32.360	last I heard. So he can change it. But the
387	00:25:32.370	00:25:35.750	dynamic for the last month has been one thing after
388	00:25:35.760	00:25:38.350	another and really for the last week all he communicated
389	00:25:38.360	00:25:40.610	in New Hampshire was why he wasn't coming. Does he
390	00:25:40.620	00:25:43.110	hurt himself? Yes. I think he has. First, it's a
391	00:25:43.120	00:25:44.960	sign is he too smug? And in New Hampshire, they're
392	00:25:44.970	00:25:46.630	only allowed to be smug. No one else is allowed
393	00:25:46.640	00:25:49.410	to be smug in New Hampshire. But, secondly because he
394	00:25:49.420	00:25:52.070	needs practice. The guy has not been out debating. There
395	00:25:52.080	00:25:55.180	were some weird questions last night about marijuana, industrial hemp
396	00:25:55.190	00:25:58.830	or whatever. And more are coming. NASA--you need practice.
397	00:25:58.840	00:26:02.120	So, he needs some help on that. Finally, he is
398	00:26:02.130	00:26:04.060	going to show up and debate finally, and when that
399	00:26:04.070	00:26:06.250	comes, us media types are going to be there in
400	00:26:06.260	00:26:08.910	force. And if he had shown up at all, no
401	00:26:08.920	00:26:11.250	individual debate would be so important. But if he only
402	00:26:11.260	00:26:13.750	shows up at a few, each one is mammoth. And
403	00:26:13.760	00:26:17.400	a mistake there becomes catastrophic. The Democrats--your analysis of
404	00:26:17.410	00:26:19.450	how Gore did the other night, David. I'm a little
405	00:26:19.460	00:26:22.020	outside what I see the polls are today. I thought
406	00:26:22.030	00:26:25.380	Bradley wiped the floor with him. I thought Bradley said-
407	00:26:25.390	00:26:27.400	came out and said, I'm a grown-up guy. I'm sitting
408	00:26:27.410	00:26:30.450	here telling you what I believe. Al Gore struck me,
409	00:26:30.460	00:26:33.320	he took the focus group Viagra...and he just came
410	00:26:33.330	00:26:35.810	out and said-What? You said focus group Viagra? Yes.
411	00:26:35.820	00:26:38.350	Somebody compared him to an animal that had been caged
412	00:26:38.360	00:26:40.390	up, and they let him loose, and he was oozing
413	00:26:40.400	00:26:43.810	empathy and doing these cheap tricks. I thought the trick
414	00:26:43.820	00:26:46.560	of staying later after the cameras and going on for
415	00:26:46.570	00:26:48.950	another 90 minutes, somebody said it looked like a kid
416	00:26:48.960	00:26:51.330	who volunteers for more homework. I though it just looks
417	00:26:51.340	00:26:53.740	artificial. And that plays into the line the Bradley people
418	00:26:53.750	00:26:56.880	have been pitching, which is that he's the authentic candidate
419	00:26:56.890	00:27:01.530	and Gore is the synthetic candidate. Bradley is dull but
420	00:27:01.540	00:27:05.300	dignified, Gore is Cheese Whiz. And I think that debate
421	00:27:05.310	00:27:08.350	to me, that underlined that Bradley line. Tom. That's a
422	00:27:08.360	00:27:14.790	lot of certainty which I can't match. Try. A little
423	00:27:14.800	00:27:18.230	bit more agnostic, perhaps. Maybe as a little clue to
424	00:27:18.240	00:27:20.720	what I thought was happening. You know, everybody gets asked
425	00:27:20.730	00:27:23.740	who's your favorite President. That's a standard one. I don't
426	00:27:23.750	00:27:25.640	know if Bush is ready for it, but these guys
427	00:27:25.650	00:27:31.790	get it all the time. He better say...Exactly. That's
428	00:27:31.800	00:27:36.270	easy. But Senator Bradley has always for some obscure reason
429	00:27:36.280	00:27:40.620	included James K. Polk in his pantheon of heroes. And
430	00:27:40.630	00:27:44.840	on Wednesday night James K. Polk was missing. And I'm
431	00:27:44.850	00:27:50.170	thinking why is that? I think he is beginning to
432	00:27:50.180	00:27:53.540	realize that he is the favorite in New Hampshire and
433	00:27:53.550	00:27:57.430	perhaps in the Northeast, and he's adjusting to it a
434	00:27:57.440	00:28:01.140	little bit awkwardly. And I think his own people had
435	00:28:01.150	00:28:03.970	a little problem with his performance Wednesday night because they
436	00:28:03.980	00:28:05.500	thought he might have been a little stiff and a
437	00:28:05.510	00:28:09.570	little bit standoffish. But is that the natural Bill Bradley?
438	00:28:09.580	00:28:14.410	Mostly. I didn't think he was as engaged in the
439	00:28:14.420	00:28:17.240	audience as he is in his meetings when you almost
440	00:28:17.250	00:28:20.030	feel like you're having a conversation with him. It's that
441	00:28:20.040	00:28:25.260	intimate and successful...a little less so Wednesday night. Gore,
442	00:28:25.270	00:28:27.520	people could see what's going on for the last six
443	00:28:27.530	00:28:31.310	weeks. It appears to have stabilized the situation in New
444	00:28:31.320	00:28:34.610	Hampshire. One reason I shrink from David's certainty here....I
445	00:28:34.620	00:28:40.220	said I was outside the mainstream. You know-I hear
446	00:28:40.230	00:28:42.420	what you're saying and I think it's entirely valid. What
447	00:28:42.430	00:28:46.330	holds me back is that I have experienced some of
448	00:28:46.340	00:28:48.970	this Gore-these Gore meetings. They can go on for
449	00:28:48.980	00:28:51.240	two or three hours. I mean, he stays until the
450	00:28:51.250	00:28:54.520	last question is asked. It could be UFO's, it could
451	00:28:54.530	00:28:58.350	be paving roads in northern New Hampshire. He'll just stay.
452	00:28:58.360	00:29:01.090	And some people in the national press had an opportunity
453	00:29:01.100	00:29:03.920	Wednesday night to actually see what this is like. You
454	00:29:03.930	00:29:06.200	walked into that room afterwards. He sat there for two
455	00:29:06.210	00:29:08.910	hours on the stage with his stage dangling over--with
456	00:29:08.920	00:29:13.180	his wife, just having a conversation. And it works. There
457	00:29:13.190	00:29:16.160	is a personal connection that goes on. And it is
458	00:29:16.170	00:29:19.700	a different kind of relationship between Gore and voters than
459	00:29:19.710	00:29:24.410	there was, say in September. What's different is that this
460	00:29:24.420	00:29:29.300	is a close race. It feels like Ford-Reagan in 1976.
461	00:29:29.310	00:29:31.390	And that's what holds me back from saying one of
462	00:29:31.400	00:29:33.320	them is pulling way out in front. But are the
463	00:29:33.330	00:29:35.680	two of you are talking from two different perspectives? You're
464	00:29:35.690	00:29:38.950	talking about the way they project on television. You're talking
465	00:29:38.960	00:29:43.330	about the way they project closeup--in other words, retail-wholesale.
466	00:29:43.340	00:29:46.200	Well, yes, except the coverage of Gore in New Hampshire
467	00:29:46.210	00:29:49.070	and Iowa is more intimate, also and I think that
468	00:29:49.080	00:29:52.880	accounts for some of the stabilizing that's gone on. Do
469	00:29:52.890	00:29:55.200	you agree, David, with what Tom said, that the race
470	00:29:55.210	00:29:58.490	feels close? Oh, absolutely. I mean the polls are now
471	00:29:58.500	00:30:00.410	within four or five points. And you can sense it
472	00:30:00.420	00:30:03.530	in the way Gore is attacking. His people clearly think
473	00:30:03.540	00:30:05.820	he's best on the attack. To me, again it's a
474	00:30:05.830	00:30:07.580	little weird. It's like watching an eagle scout trying to
475	00:30:07.590	00:30:11.440	mug somebody. I don't find him persuasive. But I think
476	00:30:11.450	00:30:15.500	the thing they know is that he can't be defensive.
477	00:30:15.510	00:30:17.730	And there's also the question of how much Bradley wants
478	00:30:17.740	00:30:20.940	this. If the race gets nasty, Bradley's always been this
479	00:30:20.950	00:30:24.400	aloof guy. Is he really going to fight back? Example.
480	00:30:24.410	00:30:38.730	Save for another time. Thank you both, gentlemen. Still to
481	00:30:38.740	00:30:42.580	come on the NewsHour tonight, the morning news wars and
482	00:30:42.590	00:30:46.550	the president of Nigeria. Media Correspondent Terence Smith has the
483	00:30:46.560	00:30:54.670	morning news story. For the past five months, CBS News
484	00:30:54.680	00:30:58.080	has been getting ready to do battle. Its weapon...a
485	00:30:58.090	00:31:01.840	30 million dollar state of the art street level studio
486	00:31:01.850	00:31:04.390	in the heart of New York City. Next week, the
487	00:31:04.400	00:31:07.920	network will launch a fresh assault in the high-stakes morning
488	00:31:07.930	00:31:13.210	news television wars. This week veteran anchor Bryant Gumbel and
489	00:31:13.220	00:31:16.580	newcomer Jane Clayson led a parade of press around their
490	00:31:16.590	00:31:19.260	new set. A lot of work remained to be done
491	00:31:19.270	00:31:22.430	to get it ready by 7 AM Monday, when they
492	00:31:22.440	00:31:25.590	plan to broadcast live from this pricey piece of real
493	00:31:25.600	00:31:30.480	estate on Fifth Avenue. A few blocks away, other familiar
494	00:31:30.490	00:31:34.740	faces are already dueling in the Disneyesque precincts of Times
495	00:31:34.750	00:31:36.780	Square. I just want you to know, I'm not running
496	00:31:36.790	00:31:42.010	for anything. Charlie Gibson and Diane Sawyer of ABC getting
497	00:31:42.020	00:31:45.680	up close and personal with their indoor audience at Good
498	00:31:45.690	00:31:50.880	Morning America's new glass-walled, street-level venue...I'm Matt Lauer along
499	00:31:50.890	00:31:53.020	with Katie Couric and we've come down to check these
500	00:31:53.030	00:31:57.060	people out. And NBC's Today Show hosts sharing face time
501	00:31:57.070	00:32:01.280	with folks gathered outside their famous sidewalk studio in Rockefeller
502	00:32:01.290	00:32:04.710	Center. It's going to be a full-fledged, three-way war. Three-way
503	00:32:04.720	00:32:06.650	wars are a lot more fun than two-way wars, I
504	00:32:06.660	00:32:11.670	think. Executive producer Steve Friedman spent 10 years at the
505	00:32:11.680	00:32:14.310	Today Show, helping raise it to the top of the
506	00:32:14.320	00:32:18.830	morning news heap, where it remains today. Now CBS News
507	00:32:18.840	00:32:23.040	is counting on him to lift its perennial also-ran morning
508	00:32:23.050	00:32:29.460	show into the thick of the competition. Katie Couric and
509	00:32:29.470	00:32:33.240	Matt Lauer, the hosts of the Today Show, responded to
510	00:32:33.250	00:32:38.770	Friedman's battle cry. It's television, I hardly would describe it
511	00:32:38.780	00:32:42.340	as war. If it's war, I'm not a soldier in
512	00:32:42.350	00:32:45.290	it. It is war, I guess in a financial sense.
513	00:32:45.300	00:32:47.570	I mean there's a lot at stake. The morning's are
514	00:32:47.580	00:32:50.120	hot. The way the marketplace is right now on morning
515	00:32:50.130	00:32:52.860	television, it's the only time in network television where the
516	00:32:52.870	00:32:58.840	total audience is growing. Morning television is the new frontier,
517	00:32:58.850	00:33:01.110	the new war, the new way networks can make their
518	00:33:01.120	00:33:06.820	move on news. Indeed they can. In the last five
519	00:33:06.830	00:33:09.900	years the number of American homes with television sets in
520	00:33:09.910	00:33:13.600	use from 7 AM to 9 AM has grown 11
521	00:33:13.610	00:33:18.630	percent. The Today Show alone has 34 percent more viewers
522	00:33:18.640	00:33:21.620	than it had five years ago. You have people who
523	00:33:21.630	00:33:23.980	get up at the same time or even earlier now
524	00:33:23.990	00:33:26.960	because they have longer commutes, there is more traffic. They
525	00:33:26.970	00:33:30.410	have less time to scrub their face and change the
526	00:33:30.420	00:33:33.780	dog dish. And they want their news, they want their
527	00:33:33.790	00:33:36.250	information before they leave the house, so when they go
528	00:33:36.260	00:33:39.100	to the office and stand around the water cooler, they're
529	00:33:39.110	00:33:44.980	informed. Author Richard Hack, a former columnist for TV Guide,
530	00:33:44.990	00:33:48.680	has written "Madness in the Morning," an account of the
531	00:33:48.690	00:33:53.430	45-year competition among the morning news broadcasts. He notes that
532	00:33:53.440	00:33:56.760	while the morning news audience is growing, the evening audience
533	00:33:56.770	00:34:02.940	is shrinking...substantially. That audience has decreased. And it has
534	00:34:02.950	00:34:06.240	decreased not only because people have these longer commutes; sometimes
535	00:34:06.250	00:34:09.000	they don't make it back home in time for the
536	00:34:09.010	00:34:12.090	evening news, but because when they do get home, they
537	00:34:12.100	00:34:14.670	have more time to look at cable, to look at
538	00:34:14.680	00:34:20.460	the Internet; to have any number of distractions that previously
539	00:34:20.470	00:34:24.830	weren't even in existence. And there is network gold to
540	00:34:24.840	00:34:28.170	be mined in the morning. The economic stakes for Good
541	00:34:28.180	00:34:30.760	Morning America and the other network news shows in the
542	00:34:30.770	00:34:35.050	morning are huge, they share a gross revenue pool of
543	00:34:35.060	00:34:38.580	about 600 million dollars worth of advertising; if one of
544	00:34:38.590	00:34:42.670	these can increase it's ratings by one point it brings
545	00:34:42.680	00:34:48.330	in an extra $70 million in revenue. Steve Friedman says
546	00:34:48.340	00:34:51.770	that CBS realizes in order to be competitive as a
547	00:34:51.780	00:34:55.500	network overall they must be a player in the morning.
548	00:34:55.510	00:34:59.500	The fact is, financially, the difference between being first and
549	00:34:59.510	00:35:02.220	third in the evening might be 15 to 18 million
550	00:35:02.230	00:35:05.860	dollars. Financially, the difference between being first and third in
551	00:35:05.870	00:35:10.490	the morning is $150 million. That's why Diane Sawyer's there.
552	00:35:10.500	00:35:13.960	That's why Bryant Gumbel came back. That's why NBC pays
553	00:35:13.970	00:35:17.330	Katie Couric 6 or 7 million dollars. That's why people
554	00:35:17.340	00:35:20.210	at CBS would invest tens of millions of dollars in
555	00:35:20.220	00:35:22.030	a street level studio, just to get us on the
556	00:35:22.040	00:35:25.630	playing field. If CBS does even modestly well in the
557	00:35:25.640	00:35:28.840	morning, it will quickly make back the tens of millions
558	00:35:28.850	00:35:33.300	it spent building this new studio and begin to amortize
559	00:35:33.310	00:35:39.750	Bryant Gumbel's five-million-dollar a year salary. Gumbel, who recently anchored
560	00:35:39.760	00:35:45.270	the failed prime time CBS newsmagazine Public Eye, concedes that
561	00:35:45.280	00:35:51.220	the stakes are high. Look, I'm aware that CBS has
562	00:35:51.230	00:35:54.260	a considerable investment in this. I'm aware that there are
563	00:35:54.270	00:35:56.800	people who are going to be anxious to, to see
564	00:35:56.810	00:36:00.570	how the Bryant Gumbel on CBS compares with the Bryant
565	00:36:00.580	00:36:05.460	Gumbel of, of NBC years. Gumbel has always been a
566	00:36:05.470	00:36:08.410	lightening rod in the morning. His fans see him as
567	00:36:08.420	00:36:12.740	a probing interviewer, his critics as arrogant. Steve Friedman is
568	00:36:12.750	00:36:16.710	familiar with both reactions. Bryant Gumbel is a different kind
569	00:36:16.720	00:36:20.190	of television performer. Most people on television, no matter who
570	00:36:20.200	00:36:22.820	they are, do say to the audience, "I want you
571	00:36:22.830	00:36:27.250	to like me." Bryant does not. Bryant says to the
572	00:36:27.260	00:36:30.390	audience, "I want you to respect me." He never asks
573	00:36:30.400	00:36:33.070	the audience to like him. He'll never have a Sally
574	00:36:33.080	00:36:41.670	Field moment. Over the last four decades, morning news has
575	00:36:41.680	00:36:47.290	changed--but not a lot. The Today Show debuted in
576	00:36:47.300	00:36:51.790	1952 with the garrulous Dave Garroway, paired at one point
577	00:36:51.800	00:36:56.210	with J. Fred Muggs, the chimp. CBS soon followed with
578	00:36:56.220	00:37:00.430	newsman Walter Cronkite, aided and abetted by a puppet Lion,
579	00:37:00.440	00:37:03.740	Charlemagne...the morning shows have always been a mix of
580	00:37:03.750	00:37:15.200	news, features and low-rent entertainment. The Today Show pioneered the
581	00:37:15.210	00:37:19.960	latest "New Big Thing"--the Streetside Studio--40 years ago.
582	00:37:19.970	00:37:23.670	All these people out here are all going to work,
583	00:37:23.680	00:37:28.570	I think. They may be late too as a matter
584	00:37:28.580	00:37:31.170	of fact, but they're on 49th Street right outside our
585	00:37:31.180	00:37:35.260	communications center here. Reinventing itself, the Today Show brought the
586	00:37:35.270	00:37:39.770	street level view back in 1994. The broadcast quickly pulled
587	00:37:39.780	00:37:45.090	into first place and has remained there for 200-plus weeks.
588	00:37:45.100	00:37:48.420	Good Morning America felt it needed a face-lift too. This
589	00:37:48.430	00:37:50.800	fall it rolled out its own state of the art
590	00:37:50.810	00:37:57.910	studio. Anchor Diane Sawyer likes the interaction with the audience.
591	00:37:57.920	00:38:02.630	It's automatic energy. It's orange juice. It's a B-12 shot,
592	00:38:02.640	00:38:05.720	to have people wandering in off the street, and they
593	00:38:05.730	00:38:08.240	look up, and there you are, and maybe Garth Brooks
594	00:38:08.250	00:38:13.330	is singing or a camel is--had too much fiber.
595	00:38:13.340	00:38:15.880	Anything can be happening in the morning when they're going
596	00:38:15.890	00:38:19.510	by. Charles Gibson says that Good Morning America has evolved
597	00:38:19.520	00:38:22.710	into something very different from what he first started doing
598	00:38:22.720	00:38:26.730	nearly 13 years ago. It is a much more spontaneous
599	00:38:26.740	00:38:31.960	broadcast. It is off script. It's basically what's going through
600	00:38:31.970	00:38:34.980	your head at the moment, and it's also pushing toward
601	00:38:34.990	00:38:37.170	a little bit more high energy, and that's the reason
602	00:38:37.180	00:38:40.990	for these changes in sets. Sawyer seems to revel in
603	00:38:41.000	00:38:45.300	the more relaxed atmosphere of morning television. Here she watches
604	00:38:45.310	00:38:50.170	underwear model Antonio Sabato demonstrate his fitness with a two
605	00:38:50.180	00:38:54.150	finger pushup...and when the cameras stop rolling, she tries
606	00:38:54.160	00:39:03.560	it herself, in front of a live audience. But what
607	00:39:03.570	00:39:07.720	about CBS? Even with its new studio and a familiar
608	00:39:07.730	00:39:10.450	face in Bryant Gumbel and a fresh face in Jane
609	00:39:10.460	00:39:14.570	Clayson, can the network rise from its perennial third place
610	00:39:14.580	00:39:16.750	status in the morning? Who else is going to be
611	00:39:16.760	00:39:22.340	part of the cast? Bill Carroll of the Katz Television
612	00:39:22.350	00:39:26.900	Group is not so sure. He advises network-affiliated stations on
613	00:39:26.910	00:39:31.360	programming. Most CBS affiliates, he says, are making money with
614	00:39:31.370	00:39:35.730	their own local news broadcasts in the crucial seven-to-eight o'clock
615	00:39:35.740	00:39:38.010	hour. One of the big hurdles they're going to have
616	00:39:38.020	00:39:44.710	to face is in the most recent CBS morning incarnation,
617	00:39:44.720	00:39:49.220	a number of their stations established a 7:00 to 8:00
618	00:39:49.230	00:39:55.370	AM local presence, and a very successful local presence, and
619	00:39:55.380	00:39:58.650	in many of those markets, they're going to take a
620	00:39:58.660	00:40:02.550	"wait and see" attitude on the Bryant Gumbel effort. But
621	00:40:02.560	00:40:08.980	doesn't that condemn the new CBS effort to lower ratings?
622	00:40:08.990	00:40:10.590	Yeah, it's going to be a problem. What are you
623	00:40:10.600	00:40:13.860	going to recommend to your clients, the affiliates? Leave the
624	00:40:13.870	00:40:18.420	local news that's working at 7:00 o'clock, and run the
625	00:40:18.430	00:40:24.150	new Bryant Gumbel Early Show at 8:00 o'clock. CBS reported
626	00:40:24.160	00:40:27.530	this week that three-quarters of its affiliates plan to carry
627	00:40:27.540	00:40:31.230	the new broadcast in its entirety. Bryant Gumbel says the
628	00:40:31.240	00:40:35.950	key to overcoming the remaining affiliate reluctance is, well, news.
629	00:40:35.960	00:40:39.640	Our first half hour is going to be as hard
630	00:40:39.650	00:40:42.910	a news half hour as there is on television and
631	00:40:42.920	00:40:45.190	as comprehensive a, a news half hour as there is
632	00:40:45.200	00:40:48.940	on television because we firmly believe, that if you don't
633	00:40:48.950	00:40:53.470	deliver the news you lose--plain and simple. Beyond news,
634	00:40:53.480	00:40:56.470	Friedman says he is prepared to cut special deals to
635	00:40:56.480	00:41:01.380	book high profile, marquee guests...deals such as promising multiple
636	00:41:01.390	00:41:05.350	appearances, a kind of journalistic horse trading that the Today
637	00:41:05.360	00:41:09.070	Show recently renounced. So, you're ready to deal? I'm ready
638	00:41:09.080	00:41:11.330	to deal. And the Today Show says they're not going
639	00:41:11.340	00:41:14.510	to deal. They won't deal unless they're forced to. Maybe
640	00:41:14.520	00:41:17.840	they will, maybe they won't. Katie Couric says they won't.
641	00:41:17.850	00:41:20.840	I think deal making is very dangerous in this business.
642	00:41:20.850	00:41:24.150	Why? Because you can be held hostage by a movie
643	00:41:24.160	00:41:28.940	company, a publicist, an actor or actress, an author who
644	00:41:28.950	00:41:32.910	obviously wants maximum air time but it gets into the
645	00:41:32.920	00:41:38.720	editorial decision-making where it's inappropriate. You know, you're doing eight
646	00:41:38.730	00:41:43.080	parts on a movie that frankly ain't very good or
647	00:41:43.090	00:41:47.920	doesn't deserve that much national airtime. The Today Show displayed
648	00:41:47.930	00:41:51.130	its draw for top talent and willingness to pounce this
649	00:41:51.140	00:41:55.610	week, when it scooped up singer Mariah Carey. CBS had
650	00:41:55.620	00:41:57.840	planned to kick off The Early Show with a Carey
651	00:41:57.850	00:42:01.810	concert outside their studio on Fifth Avenue. When they failed
652	00:42:01.820	00:42:05.420	to get permits in time for Carey's deadline, she bolted
653	00:42:05.430	00:42:07.570	to the Today Show. There are going to be some
654	00:42:07.580	00:42:12.010	ferocious, behind the scenes battles for the top names. Beyond
655	00:42:12.020	00:42:14.690	the booking wars, there is the content of the show
656	00:42:14.700	00:42:18.830	itself. Will the hard news approach work for CBS? Author
657	00:42:18.840	00:42:22.570	Richard Hack has his doubts. The idea that CBS has
658	00:42:22.580	00:42:25.660	for The Early Show is to make it more edgy,
659	00:42:25.670	00:42:28.950	hard news type of broadcast. Bryant Gumbel works very well
660	00:42:28.960	00:42:32.010	in that type of format and of course CBS has
661	00:42:32.020	00:42:35.370	a lot of history doing that kind of show. Unfortunately,
662	00:42:35.380	00:42:39.750	nobody has remembered that it doesn't work. What happens with
663	00:42:39.760	00:42:42.710	that kind of program is that you get people to
664	00:42:42.720	00:42:45.300	tune in, they expect to see the Today Show, they
665	00:42:45.310	00:42:48.550	expect to see Good Morning America, what they get is
666	00:42:48.560	00:42:55.070	CNN. If they wanted CNN, they would tune in CNN.
667	00:42:55.080	00:42:58.570	But Bryant Gumbel thinks his prospects--and those of CBS--
668	00:42:58.580	00:43:03.200	have never been brighter. I'm going into this, obviously, expecting
669	00:43:03.210	00:43:08.700	to do well, and hoping to do well, but I'm
670	00:43:08.710	00:43:11.580	not going to slit my wrists, you know? Perhaps not.
671	00:43:11.590	00:43:14.980	But executives at CBS News--and the other cash strapped
672	00:43:14.990	00:43:18.500	news divisions--recognize that the morning time slot
673	00:43:18.510	00:43:22.020	is their best opportunity to build audiences and in the
674	00:43:22.030	00:43:35.270	process, prop up the bottom line. Finally tonight, the visit
675	00:43:35.280	00:43:39.510	of Nigeria's new leader to Washington. Ray Suarez has that
676	00:43:39.520	00:43:44.260	story. Early this year, for the first time in 15
677	00:43:44.270	00:43:48.800	years, Nigerians chose their president, and nearly 30 million citizens
678	00:43:48.810	00:43:52.400	cast ballots that ended 16 years of military rule in
679	00:43:52.410	00:43:56.510	the West African nation. Nigeria, about twice the size of
680	00:43:56.520	00:43:59.530	California, was once on the road to becoming a wealthy
681	00:43:59.540	00:44:02.700	nation. It's one of the world's top oil producers. But
682	00:44:02.710	00:44:05.950	for years, corrupt governments and businesses have been accused of
683	00:44:05.960	00:44:10.060	siphoning off much of the wealth. Most of Nigeria's 110
684	00:44:10.070	00:44:16.020	million people live in poverty. During military rule, political repression
685	00:44:16.030	00:44:20.520	in Nigeria drew intense criticism. And the 1995 hanging of
686	00:44:20.530	00:44:24.520	poet and human rights crusader Ken Saro-Wiwa and several others
687	00:44:24.530	00:44:29.640	brought international pressure to penalize Nigeria. International bodies voted to
688	00:44:29.650	00:44:34.640	sanction the country, but were largely ineffective. But after the
689	00:44:34.650	00:44:38.910	death of General Sani Abacha, the country's military rulers agreed
690	00:44:38.920	00:44:42.410	to an election. The winner was a former military ruler,
691	00:44:42.420	00:44:47.830	General Olusegun Obasanjo, now in traditional garb instead of army
692	00:44:47.840	00:44:52.380	green. Obasanjo served as president in the late 70's. He
693	00:44:52.390	00:44:56.860	voluntarily relinquished power in 1979 to a civilian government that
694	00:44:56.870	00:45:01.200	was later overthrown by the military. Obasanjo spent three years
695	00:45:01.210	00:45:07.580	in prison for criticizing military rule. Despite allegations of vote
696	00:45:07.590	00:45:12.390	fraud, international monitors called the elections fair. The mood was
697	00:45:12.400	00:45:16.560	festive when Obasanjo came forward to greet the nation. The
698	00:45:16.570	00:45:24.160	people of Nigeria have made their choice. I am humbled
699	00:45:24.170	00:45:32.800	by the fact that I, Olusegun Obasanjo, am that choice.
700	00:45:32.810	00:45:36.410	During his campaign, Obasanjo promised that his government would fight
701	00:45:36.420	00:45:40.110	the corruption that made millionaires out of military cronies, and
702	00:45:40.120	00:45:44.710	makes his country frightening to investors. President Clinton after yesterday's
703	00:45:44.720	00:45:47.770	talks with the new Nigerian leader, backed up his call
704	00:45:47.780	00:45:52.480	for increased aid, and some forgiveness of Nigeria's crushing debt.
705	00:45:52.490	00:45:56.250	President Obasanjo's election in May has signaled a new day
706	00:45:56.260	00:46:00.190	for Nigeria, and a new hope for Africa. It is
707	00:46:00.200	00:46:05.940	very much in America's interests that Nigeria succeed, and therefore
708	00:46:05.950	00:46:10.580	we should assist them in their success. We intend to
709	00:46:10.590	00:46:14.200	increase our assistance to Nigeria, to expand law enforcement cooperation
710	00:46:14.210	00:46:16.840	and to work toward an agreement to stimulate trade and
711	00:46:16.850	00:46:20.080	investment between us. We intend to do what we can
712	00:46:20.090	00:46:24.870	to help Nigeria recover assets plundered by the previous regime.
713	00:46:24.880	00:46:27.190	But we must do more to realize the promise of
714	00:46:27.200	00:46:31.910	this moment for Nigeria and for Africa. President Obasanjo says,
715	00:46:31.920	00:46:34.770	if he doesn't pass power to an elected civilian after
716	00:46:34.780	00:46:37.970	his term, he will have failed. During an interview this
717	00:46:37.980	00:46:41.880	morning he stressed his country's progress and America's interests in
718	00:46:41.890	00:46:48.200	Africa's success. In recent speeches you've talked about Nigeria as
719	00:46:48.210	00:46:52.780	being a potentially great country. Certainly it's always been a
720	00:46:52.790	00:46:58.840	potentially rich country. President Clinton yesterday talked about relieving some
721	00:46:58.850	00:47:03.700	of the debt burden of heavily indebted countries. But oil
722	00:47:03.710	00:47:08.260	prices are low right now. How can you sort of
723	00:47:08.270	00:47:17.100	get the engine of the economy going? Well, President Clinton
724	00:47:17.110	00:47:28.540	got it right when he said that taking the economic
725	00:47:28.550	00:47:35.710	and social indicators as they are today, Nigeria is potentially
726	00:47:35.720	00:47:42.090	a rich country but as of today is a poor
727	00:47:42.100	00:47:50.440	country. If you like, you may even say it's not
728	00:47:50.450	00:47:55.250	that poor a country because the riches are there in
729	00:47:55.260	00:48:04.220	its human resources. And natural resources are good--but it
730	00:48:04.230	00:48:09.560	is an impoverished country. As long as Nigeria has to
731	00:48:09.570	00:48:15.440	be at the bottom of the excessive debt that hangs
732	00:48:15.450	00:48:19.560	over its head now, so long will it not be
733	00:48:19.570	00:48:25.500	able to come out or to actualize its potential. So
734	00:48:25.510	00:48:27.960	what we are saying is that for Nigeria to actualize
735	00:48:27.970	00:48:32.620	its potential it needs a lifeline, and the lifeline is
736	00:48:32.630	00:48:40.670	to help us out of its burden of debt. One
737	00:48:40.680	00:48:43.400	of the popular slogans here in Washington when you talk
738	00:48:43.410	00:48:50.850	about Africa is "trade, not aid." Doesn't Nigeria need both?
739	00:48:50.860	00:48:55.700	Fact, Africa needs both. Before you can trade, you have
740	00:48:55.710	00:49:02.510	to be in a position to prepare what you, the
741	00:49:02.520	00:49:07.750	ware that will you trade in; and to prepare the
742	00:49:07.760	00:49:11.090	ware that will you trade in, you need to be
743	00:49:11.100	00:49:17.060	helped--and that is the initial aid--to be helped
744	00:49:17.070	00:49:23.460	in a position of skill, to be helped in education,
745	00:49:23.470	00:49:30.380	to be helped even in the simple thing of how
746	00:49:30.390	00:49:34.920	do you package what you want to trade in, the
747	00:49:34.930	00:49:39.960	product, how is it packaged? Where do you look for
748	00:49:39.970	00:49:46.050	market? How do you advertise? All these will need to
749	00:49:46.060	00:49:52.340	learn and in learning those--what I call the nuts
750	00:49:52.350	00:49:58.020	and bolts--you need assistance. That's where the aid comes
751	00:49:58.030	00:50:02.910	before trade; but yes, trade not aid. But I will
752	00:50:02.920	00:50:07.640	say a little bit of aid, which will then assist--
753	00:50:07.650	00:50:12.400	a little bit of aid, which will then assist trade.
754	00:50:12.410	00:50:16.480	Nigerian troops have been in several countries in West Africa
755	00:50:16.490	00:50:24.160	in recent years; the region has had many troubles. As
756	00:50:24.170	00:50:28.570	we watch your country move into a new era trying
757	00:50:28.580	00:50:33.340	to solve some of its own problems internally, could we
758	00:50:33.350	00:50:37.740	expect that Nigeria will look inward and be less involved
759	00:50:37.750	00:50:41.430	in its region? No, we won't look inward. I believe
760	00:50:41.440	00:50:49.810	that we have a responsibility beyond our borders for peace
761	00:50:49.820	00:50:54.870	and stability in our sub-region, indeed, in our region, and
762	00:50:54.880	00:51:01.930	that's the reason why we must be strong internally--politically
763	00:51:01.940	00:51:10.140	stable--strong--and economically vibrant and buoyant. Mr. President, in
764	00:51:10.150	00:51:15.400	recent decades Americans have become quite used to bad news--
765	00:51:15.410	00:51:20.260	a steady stream of bad news from Africa. But there's
766	00:51:20.270	00:51:26.420	much bright news, too: Two big democracies, Nigeria and South
767	00:51:26.430	00:51:32.870	Africa, new on the horizon; big regional powers in their
768	00:51:32.880	00:51:36.910	parts of the continent. How does that change what happens
769	00:51:36.920	00:51:41.770	in the other countries that are neighbors of you both?
770	00:51:41.780	00:51:52.970	Well, bad news. I think I will not want America
771	00:51:52.980	00:51:57.930	to be ignored so that they expect that there can
772	00:51:57.940	00:52:01.560	be no good news from any part of the world.
773	00:52:01.570	00:52:10.980	In fact, America must make effort to ensure that good
774	00:52:10.990	00:52:14.690	news comes from all parts of the world as much
775	00:52:14.700	00:52:21.400	as possible. But having said that, the situation in South
776	00:52:21.410	00:52:30.610	Africa and Nigeria must give great hope to the two
777	00:52:30.620	00:52:38.050	countries, citizens of the two countries, and to Africans generally,
778	00:52:38.060	00:52:42.090	and to the world in particular. Now that there is
779	00:52:42.100	00:52:45.740	an elected government in your country, are you more able
780	00:52:45.750	00:52:48.900	to reach out to other parts of the continent, to
781	00:52:48.910	00:52:53.950	be welcome in other places around the world, than perhaps
782	00:52:53.960	00:52:59.120	General Abacha had been and his government? Naturally. The international
783	00:52:59.130	00:53:11.790	community stood firm and supported Nigerians through a turning to
784	00:53:11.800	00:53:17.600	fight against tyranny and of oppression of military differences with
785	00:53:17.610	00:53:30.140	Abacha. And when that struggle was successfully reached, the international
786	00:53:30.150	00:53:39.230	community became more receptive to the new dispensation and the
787	00:53:39.240	00:53:43.770	new leadership in Nigeria. And we are grateful to them
788	00:53:43.780	00:53:46.340	for that and we are grateful to God, and we
789	00:53:46.350	00:53:51.730	are grateful to our own citizens who, out of sheer
790	00:53:51.740	00:54:00.490	determination, stood firm and said, "no," and no matter what
791	00:54:00.500	00:54:05.840	it cost them. And it cost some of our compatriots
792	00:54:05.850	00:54:11.490	their lives. It cost some of us our freedom. It
793	00:54:11.500	00:54:18.330	cost some other form of deprivation. But in the end,
794	00:54:18.340	00:54:23.740	the Nigerians won. When you yourself were in jail, many
795	00:54:23.750	00:54:28.310	of your country men and women were killed, many people
796	00:54:28.320	00:54:33.690	are poor. It must be difficult to ask for patience
797	00:54:33.700	00:54:38.110	when people have done without for a long time. They
798	00:54:38.120	00:54:41.050	know that even though they have no electricity, in many
799	00:54:41.060	00:54:45.380	places, running water, that ten or twenty miles away there
800	00:54:45.390	00:54:50.240	are people with laptop computers and Mercedes Benzes. How do
801	00:54:50.250	00:54:54.290	you keep them on the road and looking forward to
802	00:54:54.300	00:54:59.860	the future? Now, there is really nothing like hope. When
803	00:54:59.870	00:55:07.140	people have hope, they have almost, they can have anything,
804	00:55:07.150	00:55:09.880	and they can wait for anything. It's when there is
805	00:55:09.890	00:55:16.620	no hope that you are frustrated out of this world.
806	00:55:16.630	00:55:20.990	What has happened in Nigeria today is that the expectations
807	00:55:21.000	00:55:25.450	are high. People who have been deprived, people who have
808	00:55:25.460	00:55:31.590	been suppressed, they now have these freedoms. They breathe new
809	00:55:31.600	00:55:37.880	fresh air and they are seeing things that are happening,
810	00:55:37.890	00:55:44.630	and they can wait. If five months ago if you
811	00:55:44.640	00:55:49.600	had to queue for twenty-four hours at the petrol station
812	00:55:49.610	00:55:54.740	to get fuel, and today we don't have to do
813	00:55:54.750	00:56:01.530	that--we can drive in and drive out--that is
814	00:56:01.540	00:56:06.500	the feeling that is pervading the air in Nigeria today,
815	00:56:06.510	00:56:17.040	the feeling of high expectation and hope that--not futile
816	00:56:17.050	00:56:26.610	expectation and hope, but expectation that can see result, and
817	00:56:26.620	00:56:35.550	therefore is fruitful expectation. Well, Mr. President, I want to
818	00:56:35.560	00:56:38.360	thank you for giving us some of your time today.
819	00:56:38.370	00:56:47.960	Thank you very much. Again, the major stories of this
820	00:56:47.970	00:56:52.490	Friday: President Clinton proposed new rules to protect patients' privacy,
821	00:56:52.500	00:56:56.470	the first federal regulations designed to keep computerized medical records
822	00:56:56.480	00:57:01.140	confidential. And Russia rejected international calls for diplomacy and launched
823	00:57:01.150	00:57:04.600	a new wave of attacks in Chechnya. We'll see you
824	00:57:04.610	00:57:08.070	online, and again here Monday evening. Have a nice weekend.
825	00:57:08.080	01:01:34.413	I'm Jim Lehrer. Thank you, and good night.
