1	00:02:15.940	00:02:19.580	Good evening. Leading the news this Tuesday, CIA Director Gates
2	00:02:19.590	00:02:23.640	called the Soviet Union "dangerously unstable." There were reports and
3	00:02:23.650	00:02:27.680	denials of Soviet President Gorbachev's plans to resign, and the
4	00:02:27.690	00:02:30.720	Mideast peace talks resumed in Washington. We'll have the details
5	00:02:30.730	00:02:33.070	in our News Summary in a moment. Judy Woodruff is
6	00:02:33.080	00:02:36.290	in New York tonight. Judy. On the NewsHour tonight, the
7	00:02:36.300	00:02:40.100	highly publicized rape trial of William Kennedy Smith is our
8	00:02:40.110	00:02:44.180	first focus. Should it be shown on national television? And
9	00:02:44.190	00:02:47.050	what effect will it have on other women who charge
10	00:02:47.060	00:02:51.040	they've been raped? We have four views. Then Kwame Holman
11	00:02:51.050	00:02:54.500	has a documentary report on the industry that keeps tabs
12	00:02:54.510	00:03:29.710	on your credit rating. CIA Director Robert Gates said today
13	00:03:29.720	00:03:34.040	the situation in the Soviet Union was dangerously unstable. Although
14	00:03:34.050	00:03:36.750	there was no threat to U.S. security, Gates said there
15	00:03:36.760	00:03:41.030	was a great potential for internal unrest. He spoke before
16	00:03:41.040	00:03:45.100	the House Armed Services Committee this morning. All of the
17	00:03:45.110	00:03:50.830	former Soviet republics face enormous economic, social, and political problems
18	00:03:50.840	00:03:53.640	that will make the transition to democracy in a market
19	00:03:53.650	00:03:59.040	economy difficult and potentially dangerous. The economy is in a
20	00:03:59.050	00:04:04.490	freefall, with no prospects for reversal in sight. Severe economic
21	00:04:04.500	00:04:09.020	conditions, including substantial shortages of food and fuel in some
22	00:04:09.030	00:04:13.620	areas, the disintegration of the armed forces and ongoing ethnic
23	00:04:13.630	00:04:16.960	conflict will combine this winter to produce the most significant
24	00:04:16.970	00:04:21.760	civil disorder in the former USSR since the Bolsheviks consolidated
25	00:04:21.770	00:04:26.410	power. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Robert Strauss, said
26	00:04:26.420	00:04:30.360	millions of Soviets were unhappy and frustrated. He also raised
27	00:04:30.370	00:04:33.510	the possibility of a military coup, saying no one had
28	00:04:33.520	00:04:36.560	heard yet from the Soviet army. He said they remained
29	00:04:36.570	00:04:40.830	a wild card. In Moscow, there were conflicting stories today
30	00:04:40.840	00:04:44.750	about whether President Gorbachev would resign. The reports came a
31	00:04:44.760	00:04:48.620	day after Gorbachev rejected the Minsk agreement which forms a
32	00:04:48.630	00:04:52.360	Slavic commonwealth from three Soviet republics. We have a report
33	00:04:52.370	00:04:57.290	by Gaby Rado of Independent Television News. Mr. Gorbachev's office
34	00:04:57.300	00:05:00.780	said he held meetings as normal inside the Kremlin today,
35	00:05:00.790	00:05:03.160	but nothing could hide the fact that the President has
36	00:05:03.170	00:05:05.600	not been seen in the flesh for more than 48
37	00:05:05.610	00:05:10.220	hours. And the speculation about a possible Gorbachev resignation heightened
38	00:05:10.230	00:05:13.690	when one of his closest and most trusted advisers, Georgy
39	00:05:13.700	00:05:17.740	Shakhnazarov, speaking to young politicians forum, let slip his own
40	00:05:17.750	00:05:23.730	opinion in answer to a question. As for your view
41	00:05:23.740	00:05:25.890	that he will have to go, that is your right
42	00:05:25.900	00:05:29.230	to think like that as representatives of parties with your
43	00:05:29.240	00:05:36.370	own positions. As I understand it, the situation's such that
44	00:05:36.380	00:05:40.450	one probably wouldn't have to wait too long for it.
45	00:05:40.460	00:05:44.250	Later, Mr. Shakhnazarov claimed his remarks had been misinterpreted. It
46	00:05:44.260	00:05:47.060	only meant that Gorbachev's fate depended on the fate of
47	00:05:47.070	00:05:51.120	the union. But it was enough for the President's official
48	00:05:51.130	00:05:54.530	spokesman to be bombarded at a news conference with inquiries
49	00:05:54.540	00:06:00.940	about his boss's future. As for the question of how
50	00:06:00.950	00:06:07.770	often President Gorbachev is thinking over his possible resignation, I
51	00:06:07.780	00:06:12.560	can say that presently he is not thinking of resigning.
52	00:06:12.570	00:06:16.180	And there was influential backing for Mr. Gorbachev's stand against
53	00:06:16.190	00:06:26.590	the Minsk agreement from inside the all union foreign ministry.
54	00:06:26.600	00:06:28.780	I am very much afraid that we are beginning to
55	00:06:28.790	00:06:37.940	witness something whose consequences cannot be predicted by anyone. There's
56	00:06:37.950	00:06:41.620	no justification for the division of an old commonwealth which
57	00:06:41.630	00:06:45.860	took decades and centuries to form. I must say this
58	00:06:45.870	00:06:52.500	very frankly. President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, sworn into office today,
59	00:06:52.510	00:06:55.510	also gave the Minsk agreement the cold shoulder. He announced
60	00:06:55.520	00:06:58.200	that rather than join the new commonwealth, he'd prefer his
61	00:06:58.210	00:07:03.860	vast republic to go it alone without the Slav nations.
62	00:07:03.870	00:07:05.950	At the same time, the split in the former Union
63	00:07:05.960	00:07:09.220	deepened, with the parliament and the Ukraine, which last weekend
64	00:07:09.230	00:07:13.040	declared itself independent, voting by a massive majority to endorse
65	00:07:13.050	00:07:19.500	the Minsk agreement. The parliament in Byelorussia followed suit. President
66	00:07:19.510	00:07:22.920	Kravchuk of Ukraine accused Mikhail Gorbachev of wanting to keep
67	00:07:22.930	00:07:29.830	his personal power intact, while simply talking about political reform.
68	00:07:29.840	00:07:33.060	But tonight a group of demonstrators backing the union gathered
69	00:07:33.070	00:07:36.250	near Red Square, claiming that the three Slav presidents had
70	00:07:36.260	00:07:40.820	effectively carried out another coup d'Ã©tat. They waved red banners.
71	00:07:40.830	00:07:43.500	The great irony is that on street level the beleaguered
72	00:07:43.510	00:07:46.940	Mr. Gorbachev is now only finding support from the hardline
73	00:07:46.950	00:07:51.390	wing who were in former times his natural opponents. In
74	00:07:51.400	00:07:55.150	Yugoslavia, the federal army renewed its attack on the Croatian
75	00:07:55.160	00:08:00.190	town of Osijek. Croatian officials said the Serbian-dominated army began
76	00:08:00.200	00:08:04.130	the shelling just after dawn this morning. United Nations officials
77	00:08:04.140	00:08:07.450	hope to send a peacekeeping force to Croatia, but U.N.
78	00:08:07.460	00:08:11.920	Secretary General Perez DeCuellar said yesterday a total cease-fire must
79	00:08:11.930	00:08:16.280	be in place first. Judy. The second round of Middle
80	00:08:16.290	00:08:21.010	East peace talks began today in Washington. Israeli delegates participated
81	00:08:21.020	00:08:24.950	in three separate sets of meetings with delegations from Syria,
82	00:08:24.960	00:08:30.000	Lebanon, and a joint Jordanian-Palestinian team. After this morning's session,
83	00:08:30.010	00:08:34.560	Israeli and Palestinian representatives said their discussions were stalled over
84	00:08:34.570	00:08:38.400	procedural differences. The Palestinians say they now want to meet
85	00:08:38.410	00:08:43.290	separately with the Israelis instead of jointly with the Jordanians.
86	00:08:43.300	00:08:47.340	Freed hostage Terry Anderson arrived back in the U.S. today
87	00:08:47.350	00:08:51.080	accompanied by his six-year-old daughter and her mother. He was
88	00:08:51.090	00:08:54.170	greeted by a large crowd of news reporters and cameras
89	00:08:54.180	00:08:58.430	at New York's Kennedy Airport. Anderson was freed last week
90	00:08:58.440	00:09:02.400	after more than six years of captivity in Lebanon. The
91	00:09:02.410	00:09:06.310	nation's foreign trade deficit rose to $10.5 billion in the
92	00:09:06.320	00:09:10.130	third quarter. The July to September deficit followed two quarters
93	00:09:10.140	00:09:14.530	of trade surpluses caused mostly by contributions by U.S. allies
94	00:09:14.540	00:09:17.720	for the cost of the Gulf War. President Bush talked
95	00:09:17.730	00:09:21.010	about trade and other economic matters on a visit to
96	00:09:21.020	00:09:24.820	Chicago today. He repeated his concerns about high unemployment and
97	00:09:24.830	00:09:28.250	slow growth, but he said there were positive developments such
98	00:09:28.260	00:09:31.620	as increased U.S. exports. He said free trade was an
99	00:09:31.630	00:09:35.070	important factor in reviving the economy. He spoke at the
100	00:09:35.080	00:09:41.160	Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Free and fair trade means more jobs
101	00:09:41.170	00:09:46.270	for Americans and we must not pull back into some
102	00:09:46.280	00:09:52.420	isolationistic sphere listening to the siren's call of America first.
103	00:09:52.430	00:09:55.460	And we need to stand together against that call from
104	00:09:55.470	00:09:58.290	the left and against that call from the right to
105	00:09:58.300	00:10:02.630	stay within ourselves. We owe the world leadership and they're
106	00:10:02.640	00:10:06.060	going to get to it from this President. Patrick Buchanan
107	00:10:06.070	00:10:10.430	announced his candidacy for the Republican Presidential nomination today. The
108	00:10:10.440	00:10:15.090	53-year-old conservative columnist and television commentator did it in Concord,
109	00:10:15.100	00:10:18.330	New Hampshire, before a group of supporters. Buchanan said his
110	00:10:18.340	00:10:21.600	candidacy will be aimed at working people of both political
111	00:10:21.610	00:10:25.100	parties. He said President Bush had broken his promise by
112	00:10:25.110	00:10:29.920	raising taxes after saying, "Read my lips, no new taxes."
113	00:10:29.930	00:10:32.740	The U.S. Supreme Court today struck down a New York
114	00:10:32.750	00:10:37.180	state law which confiscated profits made by criminals for books,
115	00:10:37.190	00:10:41.460	movies, and other materials describing their crimes. The law required
116	00:10:41.470	00:10:43.970	that the money be given to the crime victims. In
117	00:10:43.980	00:10:47.130	a unanimous ruling, the court said the law violated freedom
118	00:10:47.140	00:10:51.530	of expression. One of the country's largest credit reporting companies
119	00:10:51.540	00:10:55.180	today settled a lawsuit with 19 states and the Federal
120	00:10:55.190	00:11:00.410	Trade Commission. TRW was accused of violating consumer privacy and
121	00:11:00.420	00:11:04.750	inaccurate credit reporting. The settlement requires the company to change
122	00:11:04.760	00:11:08.640	its procedures and provide credit reports within four days to
123	00:11:08.650	00:11:13.250	consumers who ask for them. TRW maintains credit histories on
124	00:11:13.260	00:11:20.070	more than 170 million Americans. Burmese opposition leader Ansan Suchi
125	00:11:20.080	00:11:23.620	today formally received the Nobel Peace Prize. She remains under
126	00:11:23.630	00:11:27.070	House arrest in Burma and could not travel to Oslo,
127	00:11:27.080	00:11:30.270	Norway, for the ceremony. The prize was accepted by her
128	00:11:30.280	00:11:34.090	two teenage sons. Her eldest son said his mother accepted
129	00:11:34.100	00:11:36.530	in the name of the men, women and children who
130	00:11:36.540	00:11:40.160	continue to sacrifice their wellbeing, their freedom, and their lives
131	00:11:40.170	00:11:44.600	in pursuit of a democratic Burma. The 46-year-old activist has
132	00:11:44.610	00:11:49.800	led Burma's democratic reform movement since 1988. Today hundreds of
133	00:11:49.810	00:11:54.110	pro-democracy students demonstrated in the Burmese capital, calling for her
134	00:11:54.120	00:11:57.850	release. That's it for the News Summary. Just ahead on
135	00:11:57.860	00:12:01.870	the NewsHour, fallout from the William Kennedy Smith rape trial
136	00:12:01.880	00:12:04.950	and a documentary report on the credit reporting done on
137	00:12:04.960	00:12:16.980	all of us, how accurate and how private. The rape
138	00:12:16.990	00:12:20.900	trial of William Kennedy Smith is our lead tonight. Today,
139	00:12:20.910	00:12:23.920	the defendant, the nephew of the late President, John F.
140	00:12:23.930	00:12:27.700	Kennedy, and of U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy, told a jury
141	00:12:27.710	00:12:30.870	in West Palm Beach, Florida his version of what happened
142	00:12:30.880	00:12:34.390	on a beach there last March. But jury members weren't
143	00:12:34.400	00:12:37.790	the only ones listening to his testimony. The trial and
144	00:12:37.800	00:12:41.150	the events leading up to it have received widespread media
145	00:12:41.160	00:12:45.150	coverage. From the start, the trial has been a graphic,
146	00:12:45.160	00:12:49.030	even brutal, national lesson in how the criminal justice system
147	00:12:49.040	00:12:53.580	works. Whatever the charge, evidence is needed for a conviction
148	00:12:53.590	00:12:58.110	so evidence as specific as the accuser's dress and underwear
149	00:12:58.120	00:13:02.280	were examined and passed from juror to juror. The experts
150	00:13:02.290	00:13:06.540	gave their dryly factual descriptions about grains of sand and
151	00:13:06.550	00:13:10.080	semen spots and torn stockings. The bra was in very
152	00:13:10.090	00:13:13.490	good condition. I didn't note any defects or tears or
153	00:13:13.500	00:13:18.180	any stains of any sort. With reference to your background
154	00:13:18.190	00:13:22.590	in examining clothing submitted on behalf of individuals who have
155	00:13:22.600	00:13:26.430	alleged sexual battery, in how many instances have you found
156	00:13:26.440	00:13:32.040	any damage to any bras in those examinations? Very few.
157	00:13:32.050	00:13:34.510	These are things that might come up in any rape
158	00:13:34.520	00:13:38.610	trial, but this is the nationally televised trial of William
159	00:13:38.620	00:13:42.360	Kennedy Smith, accused of raping a woman at the family
160	00:13:42.370	00:13:46.210	estate in Palm Beach last Easter weekend after an evening
161	00:13:46.220	00:13:50.490	of drinking. Last Wednesday, the woman making the accusation took
162	00:13:50.500	00:13:53.540	the stand to tell her story to the jury under
163	00:13:53.550	00:13:58.270	the questioning of prosecutor Moira Lasch. Was the penis inside
164	00:13:58.280	00:14:09.290	your vagina? Yes. Did he ejaculate? Yes. Did he say
165	00:14:09.300	00:14:23.220	anything else to you? I don't know. How long -- is
166	00:14:23.230	00:14:28.360	there any way you can estimate how long he spoke?
167	00:14:28.370	00:14:31.300	I don't know. Did it appear to you that he
168	00:14:31.310	00:14:41.890	had any difficulty in entering you? Yeah. Was that painful
169	00:14:41.900	00:14:46.800	for you? Yeah. Because the trial has been covered live
170	00:14:46.810	00:14:50.920	by TV, an international audience got to hear the accuser's
171	00:14:50.930	00:14:56.040	detailed allegations. Her face was hidden by an electronic screen,
172	00:14:56.050	00:15:00.270	as required by Florida law. She described how Smith had
173	00:15:00.280	00:15:03.520	met her at a bar, danced with her, taken her
174	00:15:03.530	00:15:07.250	to the Kennedy compound, taken her walking along the beach,
175	00:15:07.260	00:15:11.580	kissed her, then tackled her and assaulted her. What do
176	00:15:11.590	00:15:18.570	you mean by the word "tackle?" I was running and
177	00:15:18.580	00:15:21.430	he hit me from behind and had me on the
178	00:15:21.440	00:15:32.030	ground. Did he ever remove your underwear? No. Were you
179	00:15:32.040	00:15:35.130	able to scratch him at all? I don't know. I
180	00:15:35.140	00:15:37.130	got my hand down there. I was trying to get
181	00:15:37.140	00:15:39.660	him out of me and I don't know if I
182	00:15:39.670	00:15:44.320	got him scratched or not. That entire account and much
183	00:15:44.330	00:15:47.970	of the evidence supporting it underwent a close and frequently
184	00:15:47.980	00:15:53.450	grueling cross-examination by Smith's lawyer. I think you told us
185	00:15:53.460	00:16:00.390	yesterday that you said that your left arm was pinned
186	00:16:00.400	00:16:04.330	down, is that correct? Yes. You said that your right
187	00:16:04.340	00:16:08.170	arm was pinned down. It was pinned between us. You
188	00:16:08.180	00:16:11.350	said that his chest was on your chest holding you
189	00:16:11.360	00:16:16.820	down, correct? Yes. You say that he was at the
190	00:16:16.830	00:16:23.920	same time pulling up your dress? He was pushing my
191	00:16:23.930	00:16:27.070	dress up. And then he was able to push your
192	00:16:27.080	00:16:31.020	panties aside, and I take it you mean by pushing
193	00:16:31.030	00:16:34.390	the crotch to the side? I don't know he did
194	00:16:34.400	00:16:37.230	it. He just, he did it. At the same time
195	00:16:37.240	00:16:40.720	he was able to enter you while unable to obtain
196	00:16:40.730	00:16:49.430	an erection? I -- all I know is he had me
197	00:16:49.440	00:16:52.520	down, he pushed my dress up, he pushed my panties
198	00:16:52.530	00:16:56.400	aside, and raped me. But your description of it is
199	00:16:56.410	00:16:59.760	that you have your right arm pinned, right, you have
200	00:16:59.770	00:17:02.800	your left arm pinned, right? My right arm is pinned
201	00:17:02.810	00:17:05.860	between his chest and my chest. And he's pushing down
202	00:17:05.870	00:17:08.000	on you? Yes. At the same time he can pull
203	00:17:08.010	00:17:10.800	up your dress, he can hold your panties aside, and
204	00:17:10.810	00:17:12.980	he could enter you without being able to obtain an
205	00:17:12.990	00:17:18.780	erection? I don't -- he raped me. Thank you. Throughout the
206	00:17:18.790	00:17:23.710	first week's testimony, Smith, himself, remained a calm, silent figure
207	00:17:23.720	00:17:27.190	seated at the defense table. Today he got his turn
208	00:17:27.200	00:17:30.870	to testify and his was a very different story than
209	00:17:30.880	00:17:35.260	the one given by his accuser. Well, she unbuttoned my
210	00:17:35.270	00:17:40.780	pants and I took her panties off and, with her
211	00:17:40.790	00:17:48.680	help, and, and we embraced and I put the towel
212	00:17:48.690	00:17:54.070	down on the lawn and she took off her panties
213	00:17:54.080	00:18:01.460	and, uh, uh, and she, we were necking for a
214	00:18:01.470	00:18:10.470	while and she was massaging me and I wasn't excited
215	00:18:10.480	00:18:15.140	and she put me inside of her and we started
216	00:18:15.150	00:18:20.270	to -- she said to be careful -- and we started to
217	00:18:20.280	00:18:26.620	make -- have sex. Whatever the jury decides, the issue of
218	00:18:26.630	00:18:29.350	so-called "date rape" has been brought to the attention of
219	00:18:29.360	00:18:32.540	millions of Americans in the past week or so. We
220	00:18:32.550	00:18:35.400	examine the impact of the trial and of its coverage
221	00:18:35.410	00:18:39.390	now from four different perspectives. Ellen Hume is the executive
222	00:18:39.400	00:18:43.420	director of the Shorenstein-Barone Center on Press & Politics at
223	00:18:43.430	00:18:48.470	Harvard University. Ann Lewis is a political analyst in Boston.
224	00:18:48.480	00:18:53.140	Steven Brill is the president and editor-in-chief of Court TV, which
225	00:18:53.150	00:18:56.910	has televised the trial daily since it began. And Susan
226	00:18:56.920	00:19:00.560	Xenarios is a clinical social worker and director of the
227	00:19:00.570	00:19:04.650	Rape Intervention Program at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital in New
228	00:19:04.660	00:19:07.830	York City. Steven Brill, first of all, how large an
229	00:19:07.840	00:19:11.750	audience, television audience, is watching this trial? You Court TV,
230	00:19:11.760	00:19:15.600	the cable channel is televising it. CNN is also televising
231	00:19:15.610	00:19:17.520	it. Do you have an estimate on how many people
232	00:19:17.530	00:19:20.480	are watching? Well, CNN's been doing large parts of it.
233	00:19:20.490	00:19:22.460	We've been doing it gavel to gavel, the way we
234	00:19:22.470	00:19:26.500	do most trials that we cover. I don't have any
235	00:19:26.510	00:19:32.610	guess, except that CNN's ratings, their normal daytime ratings, which
236	00:19:32.620	00:19:36.350	aren't that high normally, have gone up and we think
237	00:19:36.360	00:19:40.250	ours are higher than they usually are, though during the
238	00:19:40.260	00:19:42.850	day since we started in July, we've been getting very
239	00:19:42.860	00:19:44.770	high ratings with everything we've done. Well, I read the
240	00:19:44.780	00:19:48.300	other day, for example, that your channel reaches into what,
241	00:19:48.310	00:19:50.660	more than 5 million homes in the United States and
242	00:19:50.670	00:19:54.600	CNN reaches some 50 some million homes -- Yeah. -- so potentially
243	00:19:54.610	00:19:57.250	millions of people are watching. Oh, sure, that's right. Why
244	00:19:57.260	00:19:59.880	are you televising this trial? Well, for the same reason
245	00:19:59.890	00:20:04.150	we televise trials all over the country every day, 24
246	00:20:04.160	00:20:07.180	hours a day, that is what we do. We are
247	00:20:07.190	00:20:11.080	a cable channel that attempts to bring the justice system,
248	00:20:11.090	00:20:15.210	the civil justice system, the criminal justice system, to people
249	00:20:15.220	00:20:16.720	so that they can watch it, so that they can
250	00:20:16.730	00:20:20.130	be enthralled by it, and maybe even learn something by
251	00:20:20.140	00:20:24.890	watching it. We do swimming pool accident cases. We do
252	00:20:24.900	00:20:29.910	lots of criminal cases. Our goal is to demystify the
253	00:20:29.920	00:20:32.070	system. Our goal, I might add also, is to go
254	00:20:32.080	00:20:36.130	beyond the sound bytes, the lurid sound bytes that we
255	00:20:36.140	00:20:39.230	just saw just now. But is there something additional about
256	00:20:39.240	00:20:42.340	this trial because it's a Kennedy family member involved that
257	00:20:42.350	00:20:46.960	has made you interested in it and CNN? You'd have
258	00:20:46.970	00:20:48.680	to ask the people at CNN. This is the first
259	00:20:48.690	00:20:52.050	trial I've known they've ever covered. We cover all kinds
260	00:20:52.060	00:20:56.160	of trials. We cover trials involving famous people. We cover
261	00:20:56.170	00:20:58.220	trials involving people that you and I have never heard
262	00:20:58.230	00:21:00.850	of. And what purpose do you think it serves for
263	00:21:00.860	00:21:04.120	you specifically to be broadcasting this one? This one? Hmm
264	00:21:04.130	00:21:07.760	mmm. Here we have a trial where everybody comes to
265	00:21:07.770	00:21:11.700	their television set understanding who the people are and, indeed,
266	00:21:11.710	00:21:14.610	what the issue is. And by showing the actual trial,
267	00:21:14.620	00:21:17.490	I think we've provided more of a lesson in the
268	00:21:17.500	00:21:20.930	burden of proof, in the standard of beyond a reasonable
269	00:21:20.940	00:21:24.790	doubt, and the whole issue, as you pointed out, of
270	00:21:24.800	00:21:27.910	date rape or acquaintance rape than people would get if
271	00:21:27.920	00:21:31.640	they stacked a bunch of civics textbooks on their head
272	00:21:31.650	00:21:34.260	and tried to read all of them. Ellen Hume, what
273	00:21:34.270	00:21:36.920	purpose do you think is served by televising this trial
274	00:21:36.930	00:21:41.170	nationally? Well, I think it gives an opportunity for people
275	00:21:41.180	00:21:44.990	like Steven Brill and for CNN and all news organizations
276	00:21:45.000	00:21:47.920	to get a big kick, a big circulation in viewership
277	00:21:47.930	00:21:53.130	hit. News has become entertainment and what's more entertaining, despite
278	00:21:53.140	00:21:56.820	the down side, it creates even more victims than might
279	00:21:56.830	00:22:00.670	be there in the courtroom, but it's very entertaining to
280	00:22:00.680	00:22:04.180	look at the rich and the powerful getting into trouble.
281	00:22:04.190	00:22:06.620	And if sex is involved, then naturally it's going to
282	00:22:06.630	00:22:09.660	be even more exciting for these people. A lot of
283	00:22:09.670	00:22:14.350	what we do, our gavel-to-gavel coverage, isn't nearly as entertaining
284	00:22:14.360	00:22:19.300	as PBS's selection of these very lurid sound bytes. We
285	00:22:19.310	00:22:24.020	do the whole trial, the boring stuff, the stuff that's
286	00:22:24.030	00:22:26.900	very interesting, and we are a news organization. We are
287	00:22:26.910	00:22:30.000	a news organization covering the legal system that is second
288	00:22:30.010	00:22:33.000	to none. We are run by people who publish legal
289	00:22:33.010	00:22:36.470	publications that are second to none. And the fact that
290	00:22:36.480	00:22:39.960	it's entertaining, I'm not sure what Ellen means by the
291	00:22:39.970	00:22:42.470	difference between entertainment and news. Maybe she can help us
292	00:22:42.480	00:22:46.500	with that. Ellen. Well, clearly, I'm not saying that it's
293	00:22:46.510	00:22:50.640	your fault that you're broadcasting trials. I think that's probably
294	00:22:50.650	00:22:53.280	going to be a very interesting and good channel. I'm
295	00:22:53.290	00:22:56.940	talking about the news judgment when people want to devote,
296	00:22:56.950	00:23:00.190	perhaps CNN, want to devote a large amount of time
297	00:23:00.200	00:23:04.380	or space in the newspaper to a trial of this
298	00:23:04.390	00:23:07.910	nature that isn't really advancing anybody's knowledge of anything, clearly
299	00:23:07.920	00:23:11.850	they're doing it because it's scintillating, it's salacious, when, in
300	00:23:11.860	00:23:14.120	fact, we're not devoting that kind of space to the
301	00:23:14.130	00:23:18.250	Noriega trial, to the S&L crisis. I'm not talking about
302	00:23:18.260	00:23:22.200	you. I'm talking about news judgment, news gatherers, television and
303	00:23:22.210	00:23:24.660	print. And I think that there's a question of what's
304	00:23:24.670	00:23:27.010	left out when you decide to give something like this
305	00:23:27.020	00:23:29.700	this much attention. Well, you can't televise the Noriega trial
306	00:23:29.710	00:23:32.470	because cameras are not allowed in federal criminal courts. If
307	00:23:32.480	00:23:34.950	we could, we would be there ahead of this trial,
308	00:23:34.960	00:23:38.400	absolutely. And I think, as Ellen says, and much of
309	00:23:38.410	00:23:40.470	what we're talking about here is not so much, it's
310	00:23:40.480	00:23:43.140	part certainly what Court TV is doing, because your channel
311	00:23:43.150	00:23:45.640	is devoted to covering trials like this, but also what
312	00:23:45.650	00:23:48.730	CNN and what so many other news organizations are doing.
313	00:23:48.740	00:23:54.080	Ann Lewis, as someone who is interested in politics and
314	00:23:54.090	00:23:57.490	in the coverage of politics, what contribution do you think
315	00:23:57.500	00:24:03.070	is made by the coverage of an event like this?
316	00:24:03.080	00:24:05.610	Well, look, the issues of sex and power have been
317	00:24:05.620	00:24:09.070	attracting public attention since the Iliad began, with perhaps the
318	00:24:09.080	00:24:12.650	abduction of Helen by Paris. When you add to that
319	00:24:12.660	00:24:16.020	the fact that this involves, as we've just heard, names
320	00:24:16.030	00:24:19.580	that we've all been hearing about and reading about, that,
321	00:24:19.590	00:24:22.980	of course, contributes to public interest. But I think this
322	00:24:22.990	00:24:27.150	trial became a subject of public discussion long before the
323	00:24:27.160	00:24:30.630	cameras started rolling, as soon as the first stories appeared
324	00:24:30.640	00:24:33.590	in print. There's no question in my mind that we
325	00:24:33.600	00:24:36.900	as a nation have spent more time as individuals in
326	00:24:36.910	00:24:42.290	a workplace, at home, talking about issues like relations between
327	00:24:42.300	00:24:46.330	men and women, talking about what is date rape. I
328	00:24:46.340	00:24:49.960	am encouraged, I think, that there is higher sensitivity to
329	00:24:49.970	00:24:53.260	these issues, that there is more concern about what is
330	00:24:53.270	00:24:57.350	involved, about how widespread this may be, so that whatever
331	00:24:57.360	00:25:01.040	the outcome of this trial may be, as in some
332	00:25:01.050	00:25:04.330	other recent public events, I think we're all getting a
333	00:25:04.340	00:25:08.480	little education today on changing currents. But you don't see
334	00:25:08.490	00:25:10.910	that there's anything out of kilter with news coverage in
335	00:25:10.920	00:25:13.300	general? I mean, we have, after all, an economic recession
336	00:25:13.310	00:25:16.090	underway in this country. We have momentous changes happening in
337	00:25:16.100	00:25:18.770	the Soviet Union, and yet, of course, we're devoting the
338	00:25:18.780	00:25:21.850	discussion on this program tonight, but you have, again, the
339	00:25:21.860	00:25:24.590	live coverage, the extensive coverage of when these other things
340	00:25:24.600	00:25:29.580	are taking place. Ellen. Yes, that's exactly right. I think
341	00:25:29.590	00:25:31.970	that it's true that it's not only crowding out other
342	00:25:31.980	00:25:35.080	coverage, but there's an important point. In the old days,
343	00:25:35.090	00:25:39.770	the Lindburgh trial and all these other wonderful scandals that
344	00:25:39.780	00:25:43.310	made so much hey day for the press, the press
345	00:25:43.320	00:25:45.250	didn't have the same role in society that it does
346	00:25:45.260	00:25:48.700	now. Television and print press have become essential to the
347	00:25:48.710	00:25:52.780	way our society receives its news about government. The church
348	00:25:52.790	00:25:55.870	and the town crier don't have the same role they
349	00:25:55.880	00:25:58.300	used to. It's now television that is our glue, our
350	00:25:58.310	00:26:02.530	community, our culture. And when something is on television, it
351	00:26:02.540	00:26:06.690	distorts the process enormously. And I think that while I
352	00:26:06.700	00:26:08.570	wouldn't bar a trial, I think we have to have
353	00:26:08.580	00:26:11.540	a free society. We have to be able to broadcast
354	00:26:11.550	00:26:15.380	these trials. But I think that the news judgment in
355	00:26:15.390	00:26:17.900	carrying them to the extent that they have been is
356	00:26:17.910	00:26:22.640	skewed and is really a problem. Steven Brill. I would
357	00:26:22.650	00:26:28.140	love to know why the networks and CNN thought it
358	00:26:28.150	00:26:31.630	was necessary to carry the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings when
359	00:26:31.640	00:26:34.600	the subject was Long Dong Silver, but not when the
360	00:26:34.610	00:26:38.800	subject was the Constitution. We did both. This is what
361	00:26:38.810	00:26:41.640	we do. We do this for a living. So we,
362	00:26:41.650	00:26:44.420	so our news judgment, you can compare the trials we
363	00:26:44.430	00:26:47.310	cover, should we cover this, should we cover that, but
364	00:26:47.320	00:26:51.110	we covered the murder trials in El Salvador. We'll cover
365	00:26:51.120	00:26:53.750	this. We cover high profile trials and try to teach
366	00:26:53.760	00:26:56.970	people something, as Ann pointed out, by virtue of the
367	00:26:56.980	00:26:59.300	high profile trial. We lure people in and then try
368	00:26:59.310	00:27:01.500	to teach them. Ann Lewis, what about that point, that
369	00:27:01.510	00:27:05.160	there's something out of kilter, something unbalanced about news coverage
370	00:27:05.170	00:27:07.870	in all this? Well, I wonder if there is. If
371	00:27:07.880	00:27:10.080	we could, for a moment, think about a dinner table
372	00:27:10.090	00:27:13.340	with our friends and relatives and half the dinner you
373	00:27:13.350	00:27:16.540	are discussing the breakup of the Soviet Union, which is
374	00:27:16.550	00:27:19.220	really extraordinary, none of us has ever seen an empire
375	00:27:19.230	00:27:22.830	dissolve before our eyes, and the second half perhaps we're
376	00:27:22.840	00:27:26.140	talking about the Palm Beach trial. To the first, we
377	00:27:26.150	00:27:29.740	can only talk as spectators about what we are watching
378	00:27:29.750	00:27:33.640	thirdhand. To the second issue, we bring our own life
379	00:27:33.650	00:27:38.450	experiences. We all have, if not experiences just like this
380	00:27:38.460	00:27:41.760	one, we can talk about what we know, again, because
381	00:27:41.770	00:27:44.480	it comes so much closer to home, because we may
382	00:27:44.490	00:27:46.420	have children that have gone away to school that we're
383	00:27:46.430	00:27:49.600	concerned about. It seems to me it comes closer, it
384	00:27:49.610	00:27:52.410	is a different level of concern and we should not
385	00:27:52.420	00:27:57.060	be surprised if those different human reactions also get reflected
386	00:27:57.070	00:28:00.830	in news coverage. It's all one society. But does televising
387	00:28:00.840	00:28:03.770	a trial, Steven Brill, affect whether justice is done in
388	00:28:03.780	00:28:06.090	a case like this? I mean, is what we're discussing
389	00:28:06.100	00:28:09.820	totally separate from what happens with the outcome of this
390	00:28:09.830	00:28:12.580	case? There are lots of issues here. The fact is
391	00:28:12.590	00:28:15.370	that there are 46 states that will have cameras one
392	00:28:15.380	00:28:18.720	way or the other and in each of those states
393	00:28:18.730	00:28:22.870	they experimented first to see if the lawyers would ham
394	00:28:22.880	00:28:27.290	it up, would the judge react differently, would jurors be
395	00:28:27.300	00:28:30.810	intimidated? In every case after the experiment, they went forward.
396	00:28:30.820	00:28:33.700	I think one of the great lessons of this trial
397	00:28:33.710	00:28:36.470	is that we have a judge who clearly isn't hamming
398	00:28:36.480	00:28:39.400	it up. She clearly is behaving the way we'd want
399	00:28:39.410	00:28:42.450	any judge to behave. The lawyers clearly aren't hamming it
400	00:28:42.460	00:28:44.440	up. Whatever else you want to say about Moira Lasch,
401	00:28:44.450	00:28:47.300	the prosecutor, you would be hard pressed to say that
402	00:28:47.310	00:28:50.120	she's acting in a flamboyant way because the camera's there.
403	00:28:50.130	00:28:52.020	She is as dull as she can be. It's clear
404	00:28:52.030	00:28:54.500	the cameras haven't had any effect on her or on
405	00:28:54.510	00:28:59.430	Roy Black. Then the issue is whether a victim of
406	00:28:59.440	00:29:01.810	something like a rape will come forward. And we have
407	00:29:01.820	00:29:05.130	tried to deal with that I think responsibly by, as
408	00:29:05.140	00:29:09.120	your viewers saw, by blocking out the name and by
409	00:29:09.130	00:29:11.170	blocking out the face. We've done the same thing with
410	00:29:11.180	00:29:13.920	the jurors. We haven't revealed the names of the jurors,
411	00:29:13.930	00:29:16.060	even though we know them, even though Florida law very
412	00:29:16.070	00:29:18.260	much allows us to do it, because we don't want
413	00:29:18.270	00:29:20.850	those people intimidated. And, again, you made the point as
414	00:29:20.860	00:29:23.390	we were watching the tape, our tape, just before this,
415	00:29:23.400	00:29:26.310	I said in that report that the reason the victim's
416	00:29:26.320	00:29:28.760	face was blocked out was because of a Florida law,
417	00:29:28.770	00:29:31.860	and you've just corrected me and said that -- That law
418	00:29:31.870	00:29:35.780	has been overturned as unconstitutional. Indeed, it is unconstitutional. So
419	00:29:35.790	00:29:37.720	it's the decision of the news organizations to block -- We
420	00:29:37.730	00:29:41.160	have voluntarily decided at Court TV to block that out.
421	00:29:41.170	00:29:44.280	All right. Susan Xenarios, as someone who sees women day
422	00:29:44.290	00:29:46.750	in and day out who come in and who say
423	00:29:46.760	00:29:51.260	that they have been assaulted, been sexually assaulted, what effect
424	00:29:51.270	00:29:54.680	do you think this has? Well, I know that many
425	00:29:54.690	00:29:58.230	of them are very, very disturbed. We see many survivors
426	00:29:58.240	00:30:02.750	of date rape in our program. They will not come
427	00:30:02.760	00:30:06.150	forth. And I think watching a trial like this can
428	00:30:06.160	00:30:09.190	really be a detriment because I do disagree with Mr.
429	00:30:09.200	00:30:12.960	Brill, I think that there are, this is not a
430	00:30:12.970	00:30:16.150	typical rape trial, No. 1. I have testified on many
431	00:30:16.160	00:30:18.380	rape trials and I have been present in many rape
432	00:30:18.390	00:30:23.870	trials and, for instance, with undergarments being displayed in the
433	00:30:23.880	00:30:27.310	courtrooms, that is not necessarily the normal state of affairs.
434	00:30:27.320	00:30:31.680	Reports, forensic reports, are given. They are not publicly displayed.
435	00:30:31.690	00:30:36.000	I think that women who are contemplating prosecuting and taking
436	00:30:36.010	00:30:39.310	this into the criminal justice system, they will really think
437	00:30:39.320	00:30:43.610	twice. Yes. I have to say I hear what you're
438	00:30:43.620	00:30:46.220	saying and I sympathize with it, but -- and maybe Ann
439	00:30:46.230	00:30:49.020	Lewis will agree with me on this -- but the most
440	00:30:49.030	00:30:52.380	striking thing to me about the William Kennedy Smith trial
441	00:30:52.390	00:30:57.820	is that all the myths about the horrid, horrible persecution
442	00:30:57.830	00:31:01.120	of the alleged victim when she's on the witness stand
443	00:31:01.130	00:31:04.740	and is cross-examined by the defense counsel just haven't happened.
444	00:31:04.750	00:31:10.000	The judge very carefully proscribed -- let me continue -- what the
445	00:31:10.010	00:31:13.970	defense counsel could ask. That questioning was tough. We saw
446	00:31:13.980	00:31:16.230	that it was tough. But it did not go into
447	00:31:16.240	00:31:18.480	the kinds of things in her personal life. It did
448	00:31:18.490	00:31:22.640	not attack her in a personal way, the way mythologically
449	00:31:22.650	00:31:26.520	we think is going to be the fate of alleged
450	00:31:26.530	00:31:29.310	victims of rape. And I think, if anything, watching that,
451	00:31:29.320	00:31:31.470	some victims might be encouraged to come forward, because it
452	00:31:31.480	00:31:35.480	wasn't as bad as they heard it is. Susan Xenarios.
453	00:31:35.490	00:31:37.380	I hear what you're saying and I think that they
454	00:31:37.390	00:31:42.030	have been on basically good behavior, however, there have been
455	00:31:42.040	00:31:45.440	an enormous number of expert testimonies that I think were
456	00:31:45.450	00:31:48.820	tremendously irrelevant, you know, to the case. I think that
457	00:31:48.830	00:31:52.220	things were allowed in the courtroom that would not normally
458	00:31:52.230	00:31:54.850	be considered to be appropriate or relevant. In other words,
459	00:31:54.860	00:31:57.090	showing the undergarments and so forth? Yes. I think that's
460	00:31:57.100	00:32:00.430	very denigrating. It's very humiliating. It's another way to rape
461	00:32:00.440	00:32:05.560	to this woman. She is totally -- It's one rape. We
462	00:32:05.570	00:32:07.600	don't know if she was raped the first time. That's
463	00:32:07.610	00:32:12.310	correct. Right? That's correct. The allegation. That's a very important
464	00:32:12.320	00:32:14.830	point that we should not lose -- I'm not disagreeing with
465	00:32:14.840	00:32:17.660	that. I'm just saying that your point is that what
466	00:32:17.670	00:32:19.880	we're seeing, even though there has been a measure of
467	00:32:19.890	00:32:23.440	restraint on the part of the prosecutor and the defense
468	00:32:23.450	00:32:26.350	and so forth, there still is -- These are very difficult
469	00:32:26.360	00:32:29.410	cases to prosecute and they are very difficult cases to
470	00:32:29.420	00:32:34.130	experience as a victim of a rape, a date rape,
471	00:32:34.140	00:32:38.790	or any rape. And I think what this has shown
472	00:32:38.800	00:32:45.270	is the intrusiveness and the psychological violation and certainly, you
473	00:32:45.280	00:32:49.550	know, she was, although she was able to explain her
474	00:32:49.560	00:32:52.200	trauma, and I think in a very articulate way and
475	00:32:52.210	00:32:54.830	why she remembers some things and doesn't remember other things,
476	00:32:54.840	00:32:59.850	everything she said, every behavior she had is examined under
477	00:32:59.860	00:33:03.460	a microscope. And that not only is hard enough in
478	00:33:03.470	00:33:07.540	a courtroom that is private, let alone in international television.
479	00:33:07.550	00:33:10.520	And you're saying that makes it harder for women who
480	00:33:10.530	00:33:13.700	are out there? Absolutely. Ann Lewis, how do you respond
481	00:33:13.710	00:33:16.630	to that? Well, I wonder, as I was listening, I
482	00:33:16.640	00:33:21.160	certainly understand this issue of psychological violation. I've got to
483	00:33:21.170	00:33:24.630	say as someone who've been reading, working towards better treatment
484	00:33:24.640	00:33:27.740	of this whole issue of rape, we know that victims
485	00:33:27.750	00:33:30.590	of rape, women who've had this problem, have been concerned
486	00:33:30.600	00:33:34.750	for years justly because, for example, they were afraid that
487	00:33:34.760	00:33:38.000	past sexual behavior would be used against them. I mean,
488	00:33:38.010	00:33:40.860	rape has been the one crime where if you'd had
489	00:33:40.870	00:33:44.990	sexual relations with someone, supposedly you were less able to
490	00:33:45.000	00:33:48.330	protect yourself against rape, as if you could ever borrow
491	00:33:48.340	00:33:50.460	money or let someone borrow money from you, you couldn't
492	00:33:50.470	00:33:53.280	complain if they came back and stole it. What I
493	00:33:53.290	00:33:57.820	have found is not reassuring, at least demystifying about this
494	00:33:57.830	00:34:01.430	trial, is that those kinds of questions weren't raised. And
495	00:34:01.440	00:34:04.710	I think it's important, since we're here talking about television
496	00:34:04.720	00:34:08.190	and television coverage, that I found some stories that were
497	00:34:08.200	00:34:11.230	written, for example, in the New York Times, about the
498	00:34:11.240	00:34:15.010	victim and her previous behavior to be much more intrusive
499	00:34:15.020	00:34:18.200	than anything that I've seen. Stories that appeared several months
500	00:34:18.210	00:34:21.240	ago. That's right. So that we, in fact, had print
501	00:34:21.250	00:34:24.180	stories that I thought were much more damaging and that
502	00:34:24.190	00:34:27.420	lived up to the stereotype that victims or women who
503	00:34:27.430	00:34:31.030	are concerned about rape, that's what they've been concerned about,
504	00:34:31.040	00:34:33.450	just those kind of stories. We have not seen that
505	00:34:33.460	00:34:35.580	in this trial. What about that? I would add we
506	00:34:35.590	00:34:38.930	just talked about the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings. I think
507	00:34:38.940	00:34:42.040	those hearings do, in fact, offer a model in that
508	00:34:42.050	00:34:45.270	they brought into people's living rooms discussions that we had
509	00:34:45.280	00:34:48.920	not previously had. Our experience seems to be that since
510	00:34:48.930	00:34:52.660	those hearings, women who've been troubled by sexual harassment are
511	00:34:52.670	00:34:55.760	much more willing to step forward. So I'm hoping that
512	00:34:55.770	00:35:00.340	ultimately this becomes an empowering experience. Ellen Hume. Well, I
513	00:35:00.350	00:35:02.950	think we're talking about a problem that is not just
514	00:35:02.960	00:35:06.140	a televising of the trial which I do think creates
515	00:35:06.150	00:35:11.060	a distortion in justice for both sides. But I also
516	00:35:11.070	00:35:13.090	think we're talking about a broader problem of the kind
517	00:35:13.100	00:35:17.020	of press attention, the spotlight, that is fixed upon both
518	00:35:17.030	00:35:19.580	sides of the trial. And there are two trials going
519	00:35:19.590	00:35:22.860	on. And in one, facts may matter, which is the
520	00:35:22.870	00:35:25.900	jury trial, one hopes the jury examines the facts, but
521	00:35:25.910	00:35:28.980	in the other, in television and print, it's more often
522	00:35:28.990	00:35:33.130	image, hearsay, rumor and gossip that matter. And that's where
523	00:35:33.140	00:35:35.650	I think the problem is with this kind of overkill
524	00:35:35.660	00:35:39.710	coverage. The one place where you don't, in television where
525	00:35:39.720	00:35:43.760	you don't have everything that Ellen just described is if
526	00:35:43.770	00:35:47.060	you're simply showing the trial. It's when you ambush people
527	00:35:47.070	00:35:49.850	outside the courthouse steps is when you have the Current
528	00:35:49.860	00:35:52.250	Affair reenacting the trial. It's when you have the New
529	00:35:52.260	00:35:54.520	York Times doing the piece it did that you have
530	00:35:54.530	00:35:57.800	all that stuff. If you show the trial, you have
531	00:35:57.810	00:36:01.240	exactly what you're talking about, Ellen. But, of course, most
532	00:36:01.250	00:36:03.870	Americans, frankly, don't have the luxury or the time to
533	00:36:03.880	00:36:05.520	be able to sit in front of a television and
534	00:36:05.530	00:36:08.330	watch every single minute of the trial. Susan Xenarios, I
535	00:36:08.340	00:36:11.150	just want to ask you, what about Ann Lewis's point
536	00:36:11.160	00:36:14.080	that all of this has the effect of demystifying the
537	00:36:14.090	00:36:17.010	process and should make women feel more comfortable? I would
538	00:36:17.020	00:36:19.810	like to believe that that's true. I think in order
539	00:36:19.820	00:36:21.780	to believe that, you also have to assume that we
540	00:36:21.790	00:36:27.680	have a culture, a social structure, that does not stigmatize,
541	00:36:27.690	00:36:31.650	that does understand the trauma that rape victims do go
542	00:36:31.660	00:36:35.310	through, that do have supportive services and a supportive criminal
543	00:36:35.320	00:36:38.260	justice system. We don't. We have a culture that still
544	00:36:38.270	00:36:42.110	stigmatizes. We have a culture that still punishes victims and
545	00:36:42.120	00:36:44.980	blames victims. And I think we have to evolve to
546	00:36:44.990	00:36:50.360	another step before we can really accept the fact that
547	00:36:50.370	00:36:53.460	something like TV coverage will really demystify and then it
548	00:36:53.470	00:36:56.560	won't be as big a problem anymore. Ann Lewis. I
549	00:36:56.570	00:36:59.400	agree that the culture that Susan began with is that's
550	00:36:59.410	00:37:00.960	the world I want to live in, that's the world
551	00:37:00.970	00:37:03.030	I want my daughters to live in. The question is:
552	00:37:03.040	00:37:06.220	How do we get there? And I think it seems
553	00:37:06.230	00:37:08.110	to me as I look at this trial, as I
554	00:37:08.120	00:37:11.570	listen to the conversations I've heard this week, I had
555	00:37:11.580	00:37:14.690	a woman say to me yesterday who works in Washington
556	00:37:14.700	00:37:16.990	that she and her friends have decided now to have
557	00:37:17.000	00:37:19.920	a benefit for a rape crisis center in Washington because
558	00:37:19.930	00:37:22.940	they're convinced they've got to do more. I'm hoping we
559	00:37:22.950	00:37:26.290	can see this discussion, this event, as steps toward that
560	00:37:26.300	00:37:29.470	culture. We can't pretend it doesn't go on. We can't
561	00:37:29.480	00:37:31.910	kid ourselves that we're already there. The issue is how
562	00:37:31.920	00:37:33.980	do we get where we need to be. Well, I
563	00:37:33.990	00:37:36.260	hope you're right. I don't know how we get to
564	00:37:36.270	00:37:38.610	where we need to be, other than people who have
565	00:37:38.620	00:37:40.760	been doing the work that I've been doing have been
566	00:37:40.770	00:37:44.070	doing this for ten, fifteen, twenty years now, and there
567	00:37:44.080	00:37:47.410	are some times in my career that I feel very
568	00:37:47.420	00:37:50.550	strongly we are ten years behind as well. Well, Susan
569	00:37:50.560	00:37:53.430	Xenarios, we thank you, Steven Brill, Ellen Hume, and Ann
570	00:37:53.440	00:37:56.890	Lewis, thank you all. Jim. Still to come on the
571	00:37:56.900	00:38:02.030	NewsHour tonight, complaints about credit reports. But first this is
572	00:38:02.040	00:38:04.810	pledge week on public television. We are taking a short
573	00:38:04.820	00:38:07.910	break now so your public television station can ask for
574	00:38:07.920	00:38:11.620	your support. That support helps keep programs like this on
575	00:38:11.630	00:38:22.860	the air. For those stations not taking a pledge break,
576	00:38:22.870	00:38:27.050	the NewsHour continues with excerpts of a grim forecast about
577	00:38:27.060	00:38:31.070	possible future events in the Soviet Union. The forecaster is
578	00:38:31.080	00:38:34.900	CIA Director Robert Gates. He testified before the House Armed
579	00:38:34.910	00:38:38.910	Services Committee this morning. As the events of the past
580	00:38:38.920	00:38:42.690	three days have demonstrated, nowhere is the progression of events
581	00:38:42.700	00:38:46.990	more confusing, the pace of change more hurtling, or the
582	00:38:47.000	00:38:50.460	conjunction of opportunities and dangers more evident than in the
583	00:38:50.470	00:38:55.720	former Soviet Union, and nowhere is a favorable resolution, that
584	00:38:55.730	00:39:00.840	is, the emergence of stable, friendly, competent democracies in Russia,
585	00:39:00.850	00:39:05.180	Ukraine, and the other former Soviet republics more vital to
586	00:39:05.190	00:39:07.920	the interests of the United States, indeed, of the whole
587	00:39:07.930	00:39:13.030	world. The Communist Old Guard's suicidal attempt to turn back
588	00:39:13.040	00:39:16.410	the clock last August, in fact, brought the prompt collapse
589	00:39:16.420	00:39:20.890	of the Soviet government and breakup of the country. The
590	00:39:20.900	00:39:25.770	newly sovereign republics vary in political complexion and they seem
591	00:39:25.780	00:39:28.740	to be interested in somehow coming together to form a
592	00:39:28.750	00:39:33.760	very loose confederation, but none of them, either individually or
593	00:39:33.770	00:39:37.460	collectively, has the desire or ability to pose as great
594	00:39:37.470	00:39:40.940	a threat to U.S. security as did the USSR for
595	00:39:40.950	00:39:45.880	so many decades. Indeed, most republics of the former USSR
596	00:39:45.890	00:39:49.820	are trying to reduce their defense burden, join Western economic
597	00:39:49.830	00:39:54.290	and security structures, and forge cooperative relationships with the United
598	00:39:54.300	00:40:01.430	States. Nevertheless, the situation is dangerously unstable. All of the
599	00:40:01.440	00:40:07.330	former Soviet republics face enormous economic, social, and political problems
600	00:40:07.340	00:40:09.960	that will make the transition to democracy in a market
601	00:40:09.970	00:40:15.390	economy difficult and potentially dangerous. The economy is in a
602	00:40:15.400	00:40:20.790	freefall with no prospects for reversal in sight. Severe economic
603	00:40:20.800	00:40:25.330	conditions, including substantial shortages of food and fuel in some
604	00:40:25.340	00:40:29.970	areas, the disintegration of the armed forces, and ongoing ethnic
605	00:40:29.980	00:40:33.310	conflict will combine this winter to produce the most significant
606	00:40:33.320	00:40:38.110	civil disorder in the former USSR since the Bolsheviks consolidated
607	00:40:38.120	00:40:45.250	power. Russian President Yeltsin has articulated bold economic reform plans
608	00:40:45.260	00:40:47.550	but it remains to be seen whether he can carry
609	00:40:47.560	00:40:51.720	them out. Market reform will be accompanied by inflation and
610	00:40:51.730	00:40:56.750	unemployment that could generate a social explosion, endangering the stability
611	00:40:56.760	00:41:01.530	of fledgling democratic governments. The possibility cannot be ruled out
612	00:41:01.540	00:41:06.330	that such circumstances could produce a return to authoritarian government,
613	00:41:06.340	00:41:09.100	whether led by reformers desperate to feed the people and
614	00:41:09.110	00:41:12.920	stave off an explosion or by nationalists driven by a
615	00:41:12.930	00:41:18.610	xenophobic, atavistic vision of Russia. I'll now turn to the
616	00:41:18.620	00:41:22.480	specific questions on military matters that you asked me to
617	00:41:22.490	00:41:28.810	address. The threat from Soviet conventional forces is shrinking daily.
618	00:41:28.820	00:41:32.800	It is important though to distinguish between their near-term capabilities
619	00:41:32.810	00:41:38.170	and their long-term potential. Frankly, I cannot envision any realistic
620	00:41:38.180	00:41:42.200	scenario in which a major conventional military threat to neighboring
621	00:41:42.210	00:41:46.320	states would emerge from the former USSR within the next
622	00:41:46.330	00:41:52.170	year or so. Instead, as Soviet leaders themselves have said,
623	00:41:52.180	00:41:54.940	have warned, over the next year or two there may
624	00:41:54.950	00:42:00.200	be greater possibility of conflict in or between various republics.
625	00:42:00.210	00:42:03.680	Such a conflict would probably be preceded by a period
626	00:42:03.690	00:42:08.730	during which indicators such as increasing political turmoil or unbearable
627	00:42:08.740	00:42:15.230	economic privation would provide some warning. Longer-range forecasts should be
628	00:42:15.240	00:42:18.320	made with great diffidence in the wake of the collapse
629	00:42:18.330	00:42:20.770	of this huge empire and in the midst of the
630	00:42:20.780	00:42:26.130	ensuing political, economic, and social revolution. Yet, it is necessary
631	00:42:26.140	00:42:29.080	both for us and for you to look beyond the
632	00:42:29.090	00:42:32.930	next year or two. We must acknowledge the possibility that
633	00:42:32.940	00:42:37.440	a new conventional military threat could reemerge in former Soviet
634	00:42:37.450	00:42:42.430	territory, particularly in Russia. Of more immediate concern is the
635	00:42:42.440	00:42:45.480	possibility that the Soviets will not be able to maintain
636	00:42:45.490	00:42:49.480	adequate safeguards in the process of reducing and dismantling much
637	00:42:49.490	00:42:54.830	of their arsenal of 30,000 nuclear weapons. For now, the
638	00:42:54.840	00:42:58.250	center retains control over those weapons through an elaborate and
639	00:42:58.260	00:43:01.810	effective system operated by the Ministry of Defense and the
640	00:43:01.820	00:43:07.180	general staff. But the center is evaporating before our eyes.
641	00:43:07.190	00:43:20.020	Those who designed the control system never anticipated this. Finally
642	00:43:20.030	00:43:23.130	tonight, a story about credit bureaus. Today, one of the
643	00:43:23.140	00:43:28.390	nation's largest, TRW, settled a lawsuit with 19 states and
644	00:43:28.400	00:43:32.120	the Federal Trade Commission. Among other things, TRW had been
645	00:43:32.130	00:43:36.980	accused of errors that unfairly lowered individuals' credit ratings. Kwame
646	00:43:36.990	00:43:45.950	Holman reports on how these credit businesses work. America runs
647	00:43:45.960	00:43:52.360	on credit. Consumers owed $729 billion in non-mortgage debt alone
648	00:43:52.370	00:43:59.990	at the end of August. A major factor making that
649	00:44:00.000	00:44:04.690	debt possible is the credit reporting industry. It supplies instantaneous
650	00:44:04.700	00:44:12.160	information on how 150 million Americans pay their bills. That
651	00:44:12.170	00:44:16.880	information is bought by stores, banks, even prospective employers to
652	00:44:16.890	00:44:20.430	help them decide whether to offer credit, a mortgage loan,
653	00:44:20.440	00:44:26.960	or a job to an individual. Three giant credit reporting
654	00:44:26.970	00:44:33.600	agencies, Equifax CBI, TRW, and Trans Union, dominate the billion
655	00:44:33.610	00:44:38.100	dollar a year industry with roughly equal shares. Criticized in
656	00:44:38.110	00:44:40.640	the past, it's only because of the bad news they
657	00:44:40.650	00:44:44.020	sometimes bear the credit bureaus have been under perhaps their
658	00:44:44.030	00:44:49.290	most serious assault. These three companies operate at an oligopoly
659	00:44:49.300	00:44:52.720	or monopolistic area and what that means in an economy
660	00:44:52.730	00:44:55.480	is that they don't have any competition. If they don't
661	00:44:55.490	00:45:00.010	have any competition, they stay fat and happy. The stockholders
662	00:45:00.020	00:45:04.220	get big returns, the management gets plush offices and high
663	00:45:04.230	00:45:08.230	salaries, and the consumers don't get what they deserve. Ed
664	00:45:08.240	00:45:13.430	Mierzwinski of the Public Interest Research Group recently sampled 155
665	00:45:13.440	00:45:18.150	complaints about credit bureaus filed with the Federal Trade Commission.
666	00:45:18.160	00:45:20.980	We found that the credit bureaus don't seem to respond
667	00:45:20.990	00:45:25.640	to consumer complaints. 63 percent of the consumers had already
668	00:45:25.650	00:45:30.940	contacted the credit bureau five times or more without satisfaction.
669	00:45:30.950	00:45:33.680	A full 100 percent of the cases, the average complaint
670	00:45:33.690	00:45:37.370	had already gone on for six months without solution before
671	00:45:37.380	00:45:41.450	the consumer contacted the government. The Public Interest Research Group's
672	00:45:41.460	00:45:45.810	study also estimated a third of consumers have serious mistakes
673	00:45:45.820	00:45:49.690	in their credit reports. Another recent survey by the Consumers
674	00:45:49.700	00:45:53.810	Union put the credit report inaccuracy figure at almost 50
675	00:45:53.820	00:45:59.250	percent. There is a serious problem. They have recklessly endangered
676	00:45:59.260	00:46:03.590	the financial lives of consumers for a long time and
677	00:46:03.600	00:46:05.560	we're going to have to do something about it. The
678	00:46:05.570	00:46:08.200	Consumers Union study, by their own admission, is not a
679	00:46:08.210	00:46:12.010	statistically valid study. US Purg by its own admission said,
680	00:46:12.020	00:46:14.280	hey, we drew a few reports of our own, of
681	00:46:14.290	00:46:18.610	our own employees, and we found this, interesting, but anecdotal.
682	00:46:18.620	00:46:22.810	Barry Connelly is a spokesman for Associated Credit Bureaus, the
683	00:46:22.820	00:46:26.320	trade group for the credit reporting industry. How about talking
684	00:46:26.330	00:46:32.860	to the four or five million other Americans who received
685	00:46:32.870	00:46:35.160	disclosure of their file, found nothing wrong with it, and
686	00:46:35.170	00:46:37.660	never spoke up, never said boo, that we never heard
687	00:46:37.670	00:46:41.490	from? That's happening every day. So I don't think you
688	00:46:41.500	00:46:47.800	can just say the industry is in disarray because of,
689	00:46:47.810	00:46:53.030	because of a few anecdotal circumstances. It is a nightmare,
690	00:46:53.040	00:47:00.430	an absolute nightmare. You feel so helpless. Ursula Daniels says
691	00:47:00.440	00:47:03.440	a single mistake in her credit file has thrown her
692	00:47:03.450	00:47:06.880	life into turmoil. My personal health has suffered. I have
693	00:47:06.890	00:47:09.880	worried a lot about this because I am concerned about
694	00:47:09.890	00:47:14.030	my credit rating. I had to get a second job
695	00:47:14.040	00:47:16.430	to be able to pay my bills because I couldn't
696	00:47:16.440	00:47:20.670	get credit anywhere. The manager downstairs in the credit union
697	00:47:20.680	00:47:23.730	actually told me it was because of the bankruptcy notation
698	00:47:23.740	00:47:27.750	on my credit report that they denied me credit. Indeed,
699	00:47:27.760	00:47:31.840	a bankruptcy appears on her credit report. The problem, says
700	00:47:31.850	00:47:36.970	Daniels, is that notation is completely inaccurate. I legally separated
701	00:47:36.980	00:47:43.940	from my husband in 1986, in February. In 1986, in
702	00:47:43.950	00:47:50.030	November of 1986, my husband declared personal bankruptcy and I
703	00:47:50.040	00:47:52.560	was very much concerned at the time to make sure
704	00:47:52.570	00:47:55.250	it does not affect me in any shape or form.
705	00:47:55.260	00:47:57.460	He said, how can it, you have not signed any
706	00:47:57.470	00:48:02.830	papers, I am doing this without your approval. Daniels, a
707	00:48:02.840	00:48:06.550	stenographer at the local power company in Washington, D.C., wrote
708	00:48:06.560	00:48:11.040	to Equifax, the credit bureau that generated her file. Daniels
709	00:48:11.050	00:48:14.620	says two years of letters and calls have done nothing
710	00:48:14.630	00:48:18.100	toward getting the bankruptcy notation corrected. It's like I'm banging
711	00:48:18.110	00:48:19.950	my head on the wall. I don't know what to
712	00:48:19.960	00:48:23.190	do. I can't afford a lawyer. It's been like a
713	00:48:23.200	00:48:26.210	snowball. It's getting worse and worse and worse because of
714	00:48:26.220	00:48:31.810	this bad thing on my credit report. Florida businessman Seymour
715	00:48:31.820	00:48:36.870	Shor says incorrect negative information remains in his credit files,
716	00:48:36.880	00:48:41.150	despite his repeated efforts to get Equifax and TRW to
717	00:48:41.160	00:48:45.770	change it. Everybody's ignored me. If they ignore you, you
718	00:48:45.780	00:48:49.240	can't argue or contest it. The file says he has
719	00:48:49.250	00:48:53.490	a wife named Dottie. Shor, currently unmarried, says he doesn't
720	00:48:53.500	00:48:57.190	even know a Dottie. '58 or '59 was my last
721	00:48:57.200	00:48:59.350	divorce. I was never married to a girl by the
722	00:48:59.360	00:49:02.650	name of Dottie. It says he holds delinquent accounts with
723	00:49:02.660	00:49:06.210	Discover Card and a bank. Shor says he never opened
724	00:49:06.220	00:49:09.890	either account. You didn't open a Discover Card account or
725	00:49:09.900	00:49:13.620	an American Express card account? No. Shor says the inaccuracies
726	00:49:13.630	00:49:16.280	made it impossible to get the major credit card he
727	00:49:16.290	00:49:19.650	needs. You believe that if the information in your Equifax
728	00:49:19.660	00:49:24.470	CBI file and in your TRW file were correct, you
729	00:49:24.480	00:49:27.280	would have been extended credit by Mastercard, Visa? Yes, I
730	00:49:27.290	00:49:30.610	believe so, because there's nothing detrimental. Now, what's it meant
731	00:49:30.620	00:49:33.940	to you that you don't have these major national credit
732	00:49:33.950	00:49:37.480	cards? For example, one time my car had a minor
733	00:49:37.490	00:49:40.710	mechanical repair, was in a mechanic's shop for two days,
734	00:49:40.720	00:49:43.120	I was without transportation. I was going to rent a
735	00:49:43.130	00:49:45.800	car, pay cash. They refused to rent me a car
736	00:49:45.810	00:49:50.800	without a credit card. We told John Baker, a senior
737	00:49:50.810	00:49:55.600	vice president at Equifax, about the complaints of Seymour Shor.
738	00:49:55.610	00:49:58.210	I think it can still happen that a person may,
739	00:49:58.220	00:50:02.480	one, have not been served properly, or that a person
740	00:50:02.490	00:50:06.530	may disagree with the status of information in their file.
741	00:50:06.540	00:50:09.870	But weeks after that interview, Seymour Shor said he still
742	00:50:09.880	00:50:13.350	disagreed with the information in his Equifax credit file that
743	00:50:13.360	00:50:16.690	said he had two delinquent accounts. Shor maintained he never
744	00:50:16.700	00:50:20.140	opened the accounts and wanted to see Equifax's evidence that
745	00:50:20.150	00:50:23.460	he did. Equifax wrote to the NewsHour that the accounts
746	00:50:23.470	00:50:27.360	were verified with credit grantors. But Shor now says the
747	00:50:27.370	00:50:32.910	questionable accounts have been removed. As for Ursula Daniels, Equifax
748	00:50:32.920	00:50:36.550	wrote that the bankruptcy Daniels claimed was inaccurate has been
749	00:50:36.560	00:50:41.230	deleted from her report because Equifax could not verify it.
750	00:50:41.240	00:50:44.200	The focus of this hearing is the Clear Credit Reporting
751	00:50:44.210	00:50:49.050	Act. In June, the controversy reached Capitol Hill. In hearings
752	00:50:49.060	00:50:53.550	before a House Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs, witnesses recounted horror
753	00:50:53.560	00:51:00.010	stories brought on by credit bureaus. The hearings had been
754	00:51:00.020	00:51:04.200	expected to produce new laws requiring the credit reporting industry
755	00:51:04.210	00:51:07.880	to be more accurate and responsive to consumers. The legislation
756	00:51:07.890	00:51:10.950	never got very far in this session of Congress, but
757	00:51:10.960	00:51:14.480	consumers won a victory today in a lawsuit against the
758	00:51:14.490	00:51:19.260	TRW Credit Bureau. It was filed last July by attorneys
759	00:51:19.270	00:51:23.590	general from 19 states, charging TRW didn't do enough to
760	00:51:23.600	00:51:26.910	keep its data accurate and was slow to correct mistakes
761	00:51:26.920	00:51:31.160	in consumers' credit files. Under the terms of today's settlement,
762	00:51:31.170	00:51:35.750	TRW agreed to improve its information gathering procedures to prevent
763	00:51:35.760	00:51:40.360	old or inaccurate data from reappearing in consumers' files. The
764	00:51:40.370	00:51:45.670	company also agreed to investigate actively information challenged by consumers,
765	00:51:45.680	00:51:49.510	check public records, if necessary, to verify the accuracy of
766	00:51:49.520	00:51:54.120	data acquired, establish a toll free hotline for complaints, and
767	00:51:54.130	00:51:59.940	disclose to consumers their individual credit ratings starting in 1993.
768	00:51:59.950	00:52:03.800	John Baker of Equifax says the credit reporting industry is
769	00:52:03.810	00:52:07.000	on a course toward better service for consumers. I think
770	00:52:07.010	00:52:09.630	if we do it right the first time, if we
771	00:52:09.640	00:52:14.210	can tell people what the picture is of how they
772	00:52:14.220	00:52:17.400	stand and what things they can do to improve their
773	00:52:17.410	00:52:20.650	credit and why it is the way it is, we'll
774	00:52:20.660	00:52:24.170	not only shorten our process and make it more effective
775	00:52:24.180	00:52:27.540	and less hassle for the consumer, we'll improve the credit
776	00:52:27.550	00:52:30.950	performance of a lot of people in society, and we'll
777	00:52:30.960	00:52:35.810	help credit grantors who would like to see that happen.
778	00:52:35.820	00:52:39.090	What effect the TRW settlement will have on proposed regulation
779	00:52:39.100	00:52:50.480	of the industry may be determined when Congress returns. Again,
780	00:52:50.490	00:52:54.150	the major stories of this Tuesday, CIA Director Gates told
781	00:52:54.160	00:52:58.670	Congress the Soviet Union was dangerously unstable, there were reports
782	00:52:58.680	00:53:02.030	Soviet President Gorbachev was about to resign. A top aide
783	00:53:02.040	00:53:05.560	denied that report. And the Mideast peace talks began again
784	00:53:05.570	00:53:08.600	in Washington. Good night, Judy. Good night, Jim. That's our
785	00:53:08.610	00:53:11.180	NewsHour for tonight. We'll be back tomorrow night. I'm Judy
786	00:53:11.190	00:55:01.620	Woodruff. Thank you and good night.
