1	00:02:19.610	00:02:22.860	The Chinese have a bold dream--to transform their country
2	00:02:22.870	00:02:25.270	into a modern industrial state by the end of the
3	00:02:25.280	00:02:28.570	century. But the China of today is still much like
4	00:02:28.580	00:02:33.360	any developing nation: short on skills, technology and capital. To
5	00:02:33.370	00:02:37.080	acquire them, the Chinese Communists are doing some very un-Marxist
6	00:02:37.090	00:03:07.890	things. Good evening. Early next month China will open its
7	00:03:07.900	00:03:11.220	first official trade exhibit in this country. Businessmen in San
8	00:03:11.230	00:03:14.430	Francisco, Chicago and New York will get a hard sales
9	00:03:14.440	00:03:18.740	pitch on products of China's industries. Since relations were normalized
10	00:03:18.750	00:03:21.610	last year, the two countries have had an unequal partnership
11	00:03:21.620	00:03:24.650	in trade. Right now, the U.S. is selling three times
12	00:03:24.660	00:03:27.860	as much to China as it's buying. But the Chinese
13	00:03:27.870	00:03:30.720	are determined to turn that 'round, and with it their
14	00:03:30.730	00:03:34.790	standard of living. It's all part of China's much-publicized Four
15	00:03:34.800	00:03:40.280	Modernizations Policy announced in February `78. By rapidly modernizing industry,
16	00:03:40.290	00:03:44.920	agriculture, technology and defense, the Chinese hope to increase per
17	00:03:44.930	00:03:49.050	capita income from the present equivalent of $150 to 1000
18	00:03:49.060	00:03:52.850	U.S. dollars a year by the year 2000. The Chinese
19	00:03:52.860	00:03:56.150	leaders have taken an interesting first step to motivate greater
20	00:03:56.160	00:04:01.240	production. They are permitting a significant amount of old-fashioned capitalism.
21	00:04:01.250	00:04:03.900	Recently they allowed a team from the BBC to film
22	00:04:03.910	00:04:08.330	some examples. So, tonight an unusual glimpse of China's new
23	00:04:08.340	00:04:12.550	business spirit. This report appeared on the BBC`s "Money" program.
24	00:04:12.560	00:04:17.740	The reporter is Paul Barry. If the Chinese have got their
25	00:04:17.750	00:04:20.740	figures right, one quarter of the world's population lives in
26	00:04:20.750	00:04:25.370	China. The national income per head is only 150 U.S.
27	00:04:25.380	00:04:28.520	dollars a year, scarcely higher than India, and the sort
28	00:04:28.530	00:04:34.090	of money a Westerner might spend in a weekend. But
29	00:04:34.100	00:04:36.760	you don't see beggars on the streets. If there's no
30	00:04:36.770	00:04:38.730	job or house for you in the city, they send
31	00:04:38.740	00:04:41.220	you to the countryside to work on the land. And
32	00:04:41.230	00:04:49.950	you go, because China is a very disciplined society. Each
33	00:04:49.960	00:04:53.070	year there are 12 million more mouths to feed, 12
34	00:04:53.080	00:04:55.720	million new pairs of hands to keep busy. It's a
35	00:04:55.730	00:05:05.360	miracle that they can raise living standards at all. To
36	00:05:05.370	00:05:09.020	give these extras jobs in industry would mean building 6000
37	00:05:09.030	00:05:12.850	new factories a year. That's the scale of China's modernization
38	00:05:12.860	00:05:28.430	task. When you look at China's industry, it's like going
39	00:05:28.440	00:05:32.610	back in time, revisiting the Industrial Revolution. Never mind that
40	00:05:32.620	00:05:35.380	it looks worse in parts of Wolverhampton, some of these
41	00:05:35.390	00:05:42.730	factories are China's pride and joy. The Far East Fan
42	00:05:42.740	00:05:49.040	Factory, near Canton, is one of them. There are 1500
43	00:05:49.050	00:05:52.660	factories in China making electric fans, and this is one
44	00:05:52.670	00:05:57.970	of the most modern. It turns out 60,000 fans a
45	00:05:57.980	00:06:00.320	year to cool the hot spots of Africa and the
46	00:06:00.330	00:06:03.030	Far East, and the assembly line makes it look bang
47	00:06:03.040	00:06:08.530	up to date. But when you get to the process,
48	00:06:08.540	00:06:14.650	you begin to have your doubts. Isn't this more like
49	00:06:14.660	00:06:23.310	"do-it-yourself" than mass production? And the further you look, the
50	00:06:23.320	00:06:31.310	stranger the story gets. This man is counting fan parts
51	00:06:31.320	00:06:33.960	to be sent into the countryside. There they will be
52	00:06:33.970	00:06:36.660	rubbed smooth by peasants and then brought all the way
53	00:06:36.670	00:06:39.570	back to the factory for painting. It's a crazy way
54	00:06:39.580	00:06:45.700	to run a business. But China has its own way
55	00:06:45.710	00:06:49.620	of doing things. This year, the factory plans to raise
56	00:06:49.630	00:06:54.300	output by a staggering 50 percent. How? Well, it's easy
57	00:06:54.310	00:06:59.160	really. We first tell our workers we are going to
58	00:06:59.170	00:07:03.320	produce more, 30,000 fans more, and then every team in
59	00:07:03.330	00:07:08.910	the factory guarantees that it will fulfill its quota. We
60	00:07:08.920	00:07:12.080	try everything we can to encourage the positive attitudes of
61	00:07:12.090	00:07:16.340	the workers, and we all apply greater effort. Some of
62	00:07:16.350	00:07:19.370	the workers will carry out technical innovation to improve their
63	00:07:19.380	00:07:25.030	equipment. There are many projects among the different units, but
64	00:07:25.040	00:07:28.350	we're all trying to produce more than our quota, and
65	00:07:28.360	00:07:35.000	that's how we do it. Like many factories in China,
66	00:07:35.010	00:07:38.460	this one desperately needs to modernize. Surprisingly, it did make
67	00:07:38.470	00:07:40.980	a profit last year, but the state took most of
68	00:07:40.990	00:07:48.650	it away to spend on other factories. Only 25,000 U.S.
69	00:07:48.660	00:07:51.950	dollars was left to buy badly needed new equipment, and
70	00:07:51.960	00:07:54.520	it's the same all over China. The jam is too
71	00:07:54.530	00:08:01.700	thinly spread. When the need for modernization is so great,
72	00:08:01.710	00:08:04.360	can such a pitifully small amount of money be enough
73	00:08:04.370	00:08:10.890	to bring factories like this up to date? We have
74	00:08:10.900	00:08:16.000	to modernize in two ways. One way is to make
75	00:08:16.010	00:08:22.280	the machines ourselves, self-reliantly. And then we also buy advanced
76	00:08:22.290	00:08:29.250	technology from abroad. But we can't do it all at
77	00:08:29.260	00:08:33.510	once. We have to do it step by step. So,
78	00:08:33.520	00:08:40.200	the $25,000--yes. that is enough. They have not got
79	00:08:40.210	00:08:42.280	money. A lot of people have taken the view that
80	00:08:42.290	00:08:44.250	this is another Middle East, just waiting to sort of
81	00:08:44.260	00:08:48.900	bounce up into the stratosphere. They haven't got enormous resources.
82	00:08:48.910	00:08:51.080	They've an enormous population, and they are short of money.
83	00:08:51.090	00:08:53.190	There's no doubt at all. So, it's going to be
84	00:08:53.200	00:08:55.980	a slow process. Deng Xiaoping himself said the country would
85	00:08:55.990	00:08:59.510	be modernized by the year 2000. In a country that
86	00:08:59.520	00:09:02.030	size, the communication's difficult, a lot of things are very
87	00:09:02.040	00:09:04.350	difficult indeed, and they are short of money. So, it's
88	00:09:04.360	00:09:16.720	going to be a slow progress. The cultural revolution in
89	00:09:16.730	00:09:22.450	China hasn't exactly helped their chances of modernization. For 10
90	00:09:22.460	00:09:26.210	years `til 1976--the country was frequently in almost total
91	00:09:26.220	00:09:29.180	chaos. Factories would stop work for months, when the Red
92	00:09:29.190	00:09:39.360	Guards arrived to root out reactionary thinkers. Millions of ordinary
93	00:09:39.370	00:09:42.220	Chinese lost their jobs or were banished to the farms
94	00:09:42.230	00:09:47.630	for political reeducation. Many committed suicide to escape persecution. For
95	00:09:47.640	00:09:51.410	a decade, political purity was paramount, and production took second
96	00:09:51.420	00:10:01.950	place. During the period of the Gang of Four, there
97	00:10:01.960	00:10:06.150	was anarchism running amok in our factory. We have tried
98	00:10:06.160	00:10:10.110	our best to reeducate the people, but the anarchic practices
99	00:10:10.120	00:10:13.020	are still there, and we have to wipe them out
100	00:10:13.030	00:10:16.850	gradually. We have to educate the workers to be more
101	00:10:16.860	00:10:19.810	disciplined and to get rid of waste, because there is
102	00:10:19.820	00:10:24.640	a lot of waste. So, we have to improve the
103	00:10:24.650	00:10:28.290	quality and quantity of our production, and we also have
104	00:10:28.300	00:10:31.540	to improve our management so that we can make a
105	00:10:31.550	00:10:36.200	better contribution to the Four Modernizations of our country. The
106	00:10:36.210	00:10:39.820	manager of this Canton textile factory survived the Cultural Revolution
107	00:10:39.830	00:10:42.800	days. Then, he was just a worker in the factory,
108	00:10:42.810	00:10:47.670	but now managerial skills like his are back in favor.
109	00:10:47.680	00:10:53.340	Before, intellectuals and educated people were struggled against and criticized.
110	00:10:53.350	00:10:55.360	There's an old saying of the Gang of Four, "The
111	00:10:55.370	00:10:59.370	more knowledge you have, the more reactionary you are." But
112	00:10:59.380	00:11:02.150	after the downfall of the Gang of Four, many changes
113	00:11:02.160	00:11:06.050	have taken place. We've reinstated three engineers and more than
114	00:11:06.060	00:11:09.700	20 technicians who had lost their positions. The Gang of
115	00:11:09.710	00:11:12.790	Four had sent them into oblivion, but we brought them
116	00:11:12.800	00:11:19.960	back again. The Cultural Revolution slogans have faded now. Boundless
117	00:11:19.970	00:11:22.430	loyalty to Chairman Mao and his thought has been rubbed
118	00:11:22.440	00:11:27.670	out. But for all the improvement, the same old problems
119	00:11:27.680	00:11:31.350	remain. China still lacks skilled labor and technicians, and the
120	00:11:31.360	00:11:35.490	machinery is still old-fashioned. Even by Third World standards. China
121	00:11:35.500	00:11:39.600	has some catching up to do. Textiles is China's biggest
122	00:11:39.610	00:11:42.980	industry, as in many developing countries. It earns a third
123	00:11:42.990	00:11:45.500	of the country's foreign exchange, and it needs to do
124	00:11:45.510	00:11:48.990	well to pay for China's modernization. But it lacks raw
125	00:11:49.000	00:11:51.410	materials, and it's not growing as fast as the planners
126	00:11:51.420	00:11:57.590	would like. So here, as in all factories, the new
127	00:11:57.600	00:12:01.480	message from the propaganda machine is going up, "Work harder,
128	00:12:01.490	00:12:09.260	fulfill the quotas, let's forget about the politics." And the
129	00:12:09.270	00:12:11.790	call to the people of China is "work with one
130	00:12:11.800	00:12:15.770	heart and one voice, achieve the Four Modernizations of our
131	00:12:15.780	00:12:25.110	country by the year 2000." But since the death of
132	00:12:25.120	00:12:28.640	Mao, more has changed than just the slogans. The capitalist
133	00:12:28.650	00:12:31.270	roaders are back in command, and they know you can
134	00:12:31.280	00:12:34.000	make someone die for communism, but it's harder to make
135	00:12:34.010	00:12:41.170	them work for it. Most girls in this factory earn
136	00:12:41.180	00:12:44.480	the standard industrial wage of seventeen pounds a month, but
137	00:12:44.490	00:12:46.650	since last year they can earn an extra seven or
138	00:12:46.660	00:12:49.230	eight pounds a month in bonus payments if they work
139	00:12:49.240	00:12:52.210	hard. And, as the cynics would expect, it's doing the
140	00:12:52.220	00:12:55.270	trick in raising production. And the workers like it, but
141	00:12:55.280	00:13:01.150	for good socialist reasons, of course. We are all very
142	00:13:01.160	00:13:04.650	happy with the bonus system. It's very good for production,
143	00:13:04.660	00:13:07.880	and it also increases our income. But we don't just
144	00:13:07.890	00:13:11.390	work for the bonus. We also want to increase production
145	00:13:11.400	00:13:15.720	and to produce better textile goods. Do you work harder
146	00:13:15.730	00:13:22.920	since the bonus system was introduced? Yes. of course. We
147	00:13:22.930	00:13:26.030	work much harder since the bonus system started, and with
148	00:13:26.040	00:13:32.670	much greater enthusiasm. And the harder we work, the more
149	00:13:32.680	00:13:37.900	the state rewards us. So, we are very happy. In
150	00:13:37.910	00:13:40.510	the Harrods of Canton, the motives of the bonus seekers
151	00:13:40.520	00:13:44.490	seem perfectly obvious. There's no reason to believe the Chinese
152	00:13:44.500	00:13:47.680	have a special aversion to money and consumer goods, or
153	00:13:47.690	00:13:54.280	that the Chinese leadership is not deliberately dangling these rewards.
154	00:13:54.290	00:13:57.530	At weekends and lunchtimes, the shop is packed with people lured
155	00:13:57.540	00:14:03.130	in by what the new consumer society has to offer.
156	00:14:03.140	00:14:06.140	This summer, plastic sandals, that would once have gone down
157	00:14:06.150	00:14:15.530	well in London's King's Road, are all the rage. There
158	00:14:15.540	00:14:22.080	are Chinese-made radios, too, for those with the money. But
159	00:14:22.090	00:14:24.870	these radios are not for the Chinese market, even though
160	00:14:24.880	00:14:29.130	they're assembled in a Chinese factory. They're Binatones bound for
161	00:14:29.140	00:14:32.340	Britain and bearing, rather strangely, the Hong Kong label on
162	00:14:32.350	00:14:38.150	the back. The Chinese are acting as subcontractors because the
163	00:14:38.160	00:14:48.230	factory can't afford to buy the parts. For the job,
164	00:14:48.240	00:14:50.930	they get the princely sum of eighty pence a radio,
165	00:14:50.940	00:14:53.780	and each worker produces just three a day and a
166	00:14:53.790	00:14:57.570	grand total of two pounds forty for the nation's coffers.
167	00:14:57.580	00:15:00.250	It seems an appalling deal for the Chinese, but it's
168	00:15:00.260	00:15:04.660	all part of the drive for modernization. The Chinese now
169	00:15:04.670	00:15:10.670	are anxious to develop their industrial capability. They are anxious
170	00:15:10.680	00:15:14.810	to attain their legitimate and rightful place in the world
171	00:15:14.820	00:15:20.450	economy by producing quality products, and they recognize that in
172	00:15:20.460	00:15:23.170	order to achieve those objectives, they are going to have
173	00:15:23.180	00:15:27.430	to accept certain basic principles of capitalism. So, would you
174	00:15:27.440	00:15:29.640	say they're a lot less interested in ideology than they
175	00:15:29.650	00:15:39.640	used to be? Most decidedly, yes. At the Canton Trade
176	00:15:39.650	00:15:43.480	Fair, the businessmen press in like prospectors. They're pursuing the
177	00:15:43.490	00:15:46.590	dream of conquering the world's biggest market, and they've come
178	00:15:46.600	00:15:50.510	from all parts of the globe--Japan, especially, but the
179	00:15:50.520	00:15:59.720	States, Australia, and Europe too. They're here because China needs
180	00:15:59.730	00:16:02.930	them. They have the money and the know-how that China
181	00:16:02.940	00:16:09.710	lacks. The businessman's dream is simple: a thousand million customers.
182	00:16:09.720	00:16:12.100	Sell one button to every Chinaman and you'll be a
183	00:16:12.110	00:16:35.070	millionaire many times over. But it has not been the
184	00:16:35.080	00:16:38.780	gold mine that the diggers expected. It's a simple problem.
185	00:16:38.790	00:16:40.860	You can't sell to people if they have no money
186	00:16:40.870	00:16:45.450	to buy with. And here at the Canton Fair, the
187	00:16:45.460	00:16:57.230	Chinese are most interested in selling. Canton is the shop
188	00:16:57.240	00:17:00.450	window for China to dress her wares to the world.
189	00:17:00.460	00:17:03.620	It's what every businessman sees when he comes, China's brave
190	00:17:03.630	00:17:06.860	new world, packed with machines that would make every Chinese
191	00:17:06.870	00:17:15.980	factory manager go green with envy. Generally, the quality of
192	00:17:15.990	00:17:19.060	Chinese products is reckoned to be good, perhaps even too
193	00:17:19.070	00:17:24.890	good for Western markets tuned to obsolescence. But it's the
194	00:17:24.900	00:17:29.260	style that's the problem. They don't seem to have much
195	00:17:29.270	00:17:34.830	of a clue about Western fashions. No doubt the idea
196	00:17:34.840	00:17:37.750	of throwing something away because you don't like the cut
197	00:17:37.760	00:17:42.060	strikes the Chinese as repulsive behavior, not socialist at all.
198	00:17:42.070	00:17:43.910	But if they don't pay more attention to the style
199	00:17:43.920	00:17:46.360	of goods that Westerners want, there will be a limit
200	00:17:46.370	00:17:52.600	to their sales abroad. So, more and more the foreign
201	00:17:52.610	00:17:56.040	textile merchants are telling them what to make. Then, supplying
202	00:17:56.050	00:17:58.840	them with patterns, the raw materials and sometimes even the
203	00:17:58.850	00:18:02.140	machines to make it with. That's what this American deal
204	00:18:02.150	00:18:08.180	is all about. The foreigners get their garments cheap, and
205	00:18:08.190	00:18:11.930	the Chinese get machines without putting down hard cash. It's
206	00:18:11.940	00:18:14.640	called a compensation trade deal, and it's happening more and
207	00:18:14.650	00:18:21.450	more in China today. The surprise is that China needs
208	00:18:21.460	00:18:34.530	help on even the simplest projects. Here, on Canton's waterfront,
209	00:18:34.540	00:18:37.100	a Hong Kong property developer and a Hong Kong bank
210	00:18:37.110	00:18:41.180	are putting up an ultramodern, 37-story hotel to lure tourists
211	00:18:41.190	00:18:44.240	into China and earn more valuable foreign exchange for the
212	00:18:44.250	00:18:47.620	country. It's the sort of thing you'd expect the Chinese
213	00:18:47.630	00:18:49.780	to be able to do for themselves, but they've not
214	00:18:49.790	00:18:52.900	got much experience of high-rise building, and they've even less
215	00:18:52.910	00:18:55.800	of running a modern hotel with the standards of service
216	00:18:55.810	00:19:01.500	that the cosseted Westerner expects. The project is a true
217	00:19:01.510	00:19:04.860	joint venture. The China and Hong Kong partners are sharing
218	00:19:04.870	00:19:08.360	the risk. And it's one of the first in China.
219	00:19:08.370	00:19:10.500	It's also the first time the Chinese have let anyone
220	00:19:10.510	00:19:24.650	film it. They've been strangely reticent in the past. The
221	00:19:24.660	00:19:28.540	hotel should be ready in 1983. The Chinese have provided
222	00:19:28.550	00:19:31.710	the land and labor as their stake in the project.
223	00:19:31.720	00:19:34.190	The Hong Kong developer and the bank bring the money,
224	00:19:34.200	00:19:37.930	the management, expertise and design. In return, they end up
225	00:19:37.940	00:19:40.350	with their share of the profits, granted that all goes
226	00:19:40.360	00:19:43.130	as smoothly as they expect. The risk? I believe the
227	00:19:43.140	00:19:47.220	Chinese are absolutely first class risks. We've been dealing, and
228	00:19:47.230	00:19:50.560	we've had an office in Shanghai right through the Cultural
229	00:19:50.570	00:19:54.720	Revolution. We've made profits, we were allowed to remit profits
230	00:19:54.730	00:19:58.960	out. To the best of my knowledge, all the deals
231	00:19:58.970	00:20:02.820	together with China's large purchase of wheat, where they've bought,
232	00:20:02.830	00:20:06.090	have all been settled promptly. I regard them as absolute
233	00:20:06.100	00:20:08.670	first class risks. Is this something we're going to see
234	00:20:08.680	00:20:11.060	more of? Are the Chinese committed to this policy? Yes,
235	00:20:11.070	00:20:13.120	they--very much the name of the game is trying
236	00:20:13.130	00:20:18.090	to export now, and they're very much committed to joint
237	00:20:18.100	00:20:21.440	ventures, and I believe we shall see many more of
238	00:20:21.450	00:20:23.660	them in the years to come. And how much do
239	00:20:23.670	00:20:25.730	they need them? What's the advantage for them? Well, the
240	00:20:25.740	00:20:30.390	advantage to them is to get the foreign exchange element
241	00:20:30.400	00:20:33.650	of a joint venture in from the foreign partner, the
242	00:20:33.660	00:20:39.300	expertise, and the marketing expertise, selling the products eventually abroad.
243	00:20:39.310	00:20:41.020	It is amazing how much they have done in the
244	00:20:41.030	00:20:46.400	span of seven months. Tin Fok, the developer, has the
245	00:20:46.410	00:20:49.620	advantage of long close ties with the People's Republic. His
246	00:20:49.630	00:20:51.980	father is one of the richest men in Hong Kong,
247	00:20:51.990	00:20:54.590	and yet also a great ally of the Communists. It's
248	00:20:54.600	00:20:57.380	said that Henry Fok, the father, ran guns for Mao's
249	00:20:57.390	00:21:00.590	army during the revolution. In any case, the Communists made
250	00:21:00.600	00:21:03.420	him richer by giving him the exclusive right to market
251	00:21:03.430	00:21:07.490	Chinese sand to Hong Kong. So for Tin Fok, making
252	00:21:07.500	00:21:13.410	money in Communist China is almost second nature. Basically, the
253	00:21:13.420	00:21:16.590	Chinese--we are a very pragmatic people, and I think
254	00:21:16.600	00:21:19.720	we are also business people. I think they do agree
255	00:21:19.730	00:21:23.350	that I don't think they enjoy the kind of exploitation
256	00:21:23.360	00:21:26.610	they have been getting for so long, but they certainly
257	00:21:26.620	00:21:31.130	know the businessman's profit is the first consideration. And with
258	00:21:31.140	00:21:36.880	certain faith, I think, you know, I think you can
259	00:21:36.890	00:21:41.670	make good, reasonable profit in China. If you have doubts
260	00:21:41.680	00:21:43.930	about what the Chinese are capable of under the right
261	00:21:43.940	00:21:47.510	conditions, you need look no further than Hong Kong. Its
262	00:21:47.520	00:21:50.590	prosperity rests on the most naked capitalism in the world
263	00:21:50.600	00:21:58.370	today, but also on Chinese who live and work here.
264	00:21:58.380	00:22:00.830	It's now the financial center of the Far East and
265	00:22:00.840	00:22:04.110	the thorn in the side of half of British industry.
266	00:22:04.120	00:22:06.530	The income per head is twenty times higher than across
267	00:22:06.540	00:22:09.230	the border, but this could be a taste of the
268	00:22:09.240	00:22:16.560	China of the future. Certainly, the ways of capitalism are
269	00:22:16.570	00:22:20.160	creeping into China wherever you look. The old China traders
270	00:22:20.170	00:22:23.850	say, "Put two Chinese together, and you've got a market."
271	00:22:23.860	00:22:30.400	And in Canton, markets are being allowed to flourish again.
272	00:22:30.410	00:22:32.820	Peasants in China are now allowed to raise produce on
273	00:22:32.830	00:22:35.950	their own land and sell the surplus in the cities.
274	00:22:35.960	00:22:38.310	Some will walk miles to do it. And the Chinese
275	00:22:38.320	00:22:41.510	leadership is discovering what many people already knew, that you
276	00:22:41.520	00:22:44.830	work hardest if you're working for yourself. And they're allowing
277	00:22:44.840	00:22:47.750	this enterprise to flourish because they realize it will speed
278	00:22:47.760	00:22:57.180	the country's modernization, just like incentives are doing. This is
279	00:22:57.190	00:23:00.270	the dream of China in the year 2000, the next
280	00:23:00.280	00:23:03.680	economic miracle from the Far East. But at the moment
281	00:23:03.690	00:23:08.220	it's just an illusion. The TV factory is in Canton,
282	00:23:08.230	00:23:14.030	but the tubes come from another China, Taiwan. And China
283	00:23:14.040	00:23:16.580	will never quite match the miracle economies of the Far
284	00:23:16.590	00:23:19.900	East like Korea or Singapore because it will never have
285	00:23:19.910	00:23:23.470	foreign money pumped in in such vast quantities. Money is
286	00:23:23.480	00:23:26.160	vital, and even the world doesn't have enough to make
287	00:23:26.170	00:23:29.520	more than a passing difference to China. And China will
288	00:23:29.530	00:23:32.820	surely never go all the way down the capitalist road.
289	00:23:32.830	00:23:35.080	Already the small steps she is taking are putting the
290	00:23:35.090	00:23:45.710	system under enormous strain. At the border of China and
291	00:23:45.720	00:23:49.110	Hong Kong, the overseas Chinese march in by the thousands
292	00:23:49.120	00:23:55.230	to see their relatives. And as the radios, TVs and
293	00:23:55.240	00:23:58.930	automatic rice cookers arrive, so the lure of capitalist goodies
294	00:23:58.940	00:24:01.650	makes more people want to get out. For every one
295	00:24:01.660	00:24:04.260	discontent that tried the home run to Hong Kong in
296	00:24:04.270	00:24:10.080	1976, 200 will do it today. This year, 200,000 could
297	00:24:10.090	00:24:19.360	succeed. And even at the textile factory back in Canton,
298	00:24:19.370	00:24:22.960	the tide of capitalist influence is having a profound effect.
299	00:24:22.970	00:24:25.060	At this meeting to decide who will get a wage
300	00:24:25.070	00:24:28.680	increase next year, the voice of individualism is disturbing the
301	00:24:28.690	00:24:38.600	collective quiet. It's not fair. Things are very hard. It's
302	00:24:38.610	00:24:59.710	crap. You mean that you work harder and get the
303	00:24:59.720	00:25:21.360	same amount of pay. I am the most skilled worker.
304	00:25:21.370	00:25:25.590	Arguments like this must surely shake China's socialism. By the
305	00:25:25.600	00:25:29.390	year 2000, some predict China will no longer be communist,
306	00:25:29.400	00:25:32.520	but it may combine the best of capitalism and socialism
307	00:25:32.530	00:25:36.480	if they're lucky. Only one thing is certain. In modernizing,
308	00:25:36.490	00:25:39.400	the Chinese leadership has set out to change China faster
309	00:25:39.410	00:25:42.500	than it has ever changed before. And for that, they'll
310	00:25:42.510	00:25:45.530	suffer from the old Chinese curse. They will live in
311	00:25:45.540	00:25:55.350	interesting times. Our country is still under the leadership of
312	00:25:55.360	00:26:01.580	the Communist Party. All we're doing now, is we're giving
313	00:26:01.590	00:26:06.770	more attention to the welfare of the individual. This will
314	00:26:06.780	00:26:12.150	not lead to capitalism. That report was by the BBC.
315	00:26:12.160	00:26:14.160	That's all for tonight. We will be back on Monday
316	00:26:14.170	00:27:58.932	night. I'm Robert MacNeil. Good night.
