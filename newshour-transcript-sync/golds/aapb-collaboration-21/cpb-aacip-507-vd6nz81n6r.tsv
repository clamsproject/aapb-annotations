1	00:01:53.210	00:01:55.870	Good evening. I'm Roger Mudd in New York. And I'm
2	00:01:55.880	00:01:59.380	Margaret Warner in Washington. After the News Summary, we update
3	00:01:59.390	00:02:03.130	the political turmoil in Moscow, preview President Clinton's health care
4	00:02:03.140	00:02:07.190	speech, look at one city's remedy, and have a Charlayne
5	00:02:07.200	00:02:49.050	Hunter-Gault conversation with journalist Michael O'Neill. At least 40 people
6	00:02:49.060	00:02:51.960	were killed this morning when an Amtrak passenger train, the
7	00:02:51.970	00:02:55.610	Sunset Limited, derailed on a bridge at Saraland, Alabama, just
8	00:02:55.620	00:02:58.750	north of Mobile. All three engines and four of the
9	00:02:58.760	00:03:01.670	eight cars left the rail just after 3 AM local
10	00:03:01.680	00:03:05.220	time. Two of the passenger cars plunged into the bayou,
11	00:03:05.230	00:03:08.730	and one of them was totally submerged. Rescue efforts were
12	00:03:08.740	00:03:13.380	hampered by darkness, fall, murky water, and some said alligators.
13	00:03:13.390	00:03:16.210	Officials said the Sunset Limited traveling from Los Angeles to
14	00:03:16.220	00:03:20.970	Miami carried 189 passengers and 17 crew members. Coast Guard
15	00:03:20.980	00:03:25.150	officials say 13 people are still unaccounted for. In Washington
16	00:03:25.160	00:03:29.060	this afternoon, an Amtrak spokesman held a news conference. There
17	00:03:29.070	00:03:33.330	really couldn't have been a worse combination of events. We
18	00:03:33.340	00:03:39.070	have a derailment, an emersion in water, fire. This is,
19	00:03:39.080	00:03:45.620	without doubt, the worst tragedy to -- that Amtrak has suffered
20	00:03:45.630	00:03:52.910	in its 23-year history. It is conceivable that today's catastrophic
21	00:03:52.920	00:04:01.160	accident could equal or eclipse the entire fatality rate for our
22	00:04:01.170	00:04:05.040	entire 23-year history. The cause of the accident is not
23	00:04:05.050	00:04:08.290	known. A freight train, reportedly, had earlier crossed the bridge
24	00:04:08.300	00:04:12.720	without incident. Officials from CSX Transportation, which owns the track,
25	00:04:12.730	00:04:17.170	and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate. Margaret. Boris
26	00:04:17.180	00:04:19.720	Yeltsin appeared to have a clear edge today in his
27	00:04:19.730	00:04:23.890	struggle with hardline opponents. The streets of Moscow remained calm
28	00:04:23.900	00:04:27.540	as Yeltsin ventured out to greet supporters. He vowed not
29	00:04:27.550	00:04:31.230	to use force to overcome his opposition. Yeltsin dissolved the
30	00:04:31.240	00:04:35.280	conservative Russian parliament yesterday and ordered new parliamentary elections in
31	00:04:35.290	00:04:39.460	December. The parliament responded by swearing in a rival acting
32	00:04:39.470	00:04:43.720	president, Alexander Rutskoi, who addressed his supporters at the parliament
33	00:04:43.730	00:04:48.380	building today. Western leaders, meanwhile, rallied around Yeltsin, saying he
34	00:04:48.390	00:04:51.660	had no alternative but to break the deadlock between himself
35	00:04:51.670	00:04:56.990	and the Communist era parliament. President Clinton expressed his support
36	00:04:57.000	00:05:00.010	for Yeltsin again today. Mr. Clinton also said he was
37	00:05:00.020	00:05:05.030	hopeful the situation would remain calm. A second passenger jet
38	00:05:05.040	00:05:08.320	was shot down in the former Soviet republic of Georgia.
39	00:05:08.330	00:05:11.380	Up to 100 people were reportedly aboard the plane, which
40	00:05:11.390	00:05:14.440	was hit after landing at Sukhumi, the capital of a
41	00:05:14.450	00:05:18.030	breakaway region in Georgia. It was not clear how many
42	00:05:18.040	00:05:21.790	may have survived the attack. Twenty-eight people were killed yesterday
43	00:05:21.800	00:05:24.480	when another passenger jet was shot down into the Black
44	00:05:24.490	00:05:28.560	Sea near the same city. Georgian officials blamed both attacks
45	00:05:28.570	00:05:33.090	on rebels fighting for independence for their breakaway region. President
46	00:05:33.100	00:05:37.480	Clinton delivers his long-awaited, long-delayed healthcare reform speech tonight before
47	00:05:37.490	00:05:40.260	a joint session of the Congress. He and Vice President
48	00:05:40.270	00:05:43.320	Gore and Mrs. Clinton briefed congressional leaders from both parties
49	00:05:43.330	00:05:46.410	at the White House this morning. Reporters asked the President
50	00:05:46.420	00:05:49.020	why he thought his plan would succeed where past attempts
51	00:05:49.030	00:05:54.370	had failed. There is almost unanimous consensus that the cost
52	00:05:54.380	00:05:57.180	of continuing on the present course is greater than the
53	00:05:57.190	00:06:01.530	cost of change. With healthcare costs rising at more than
54	00:06:01.540	00:06:04.220	twice the rate of inflation and rising much faster than
55	00:06:04.230	00:06:08.950	that for small businesses, with many people--more people losing
56	00:06:08.960	00:06:11.560	their coverage every month so that we're paying more for
57	00:06:11.570	00:06:15.400	less healthcare, with the range of choices available to Americans
58	00:06:15.410	00:06:19.420	dropping dramatically and the administrative costs of the system escalating
59	00:06:19.430	00:06:23.580	at a breathtaking rate, that the cost of going on
60	00:06:23.590	00:06:25.760	is greater than the cost of change. I don't think
61	00:06:25.770	00:06:29.850	that there's ever been that much consensus before. Republican leaders
62	00:06:29.860	00:06:33.800	have pledged their cooperation, but after today's meeting, GOP Senators
63	00:06:33.810	00:06:38.130	and representatives spoke in differing tones about bipartisanship. I have
64	00:06:38.140	00:06:41.310	indicated to the President and Mrs. Clinton a number of
65	00:06:41.320	00:06:43.640	times we're going into this on our side, at least
66	00:06:43.650	00:06:45.510	as many people as I can convince, in a very
67	00:06:45.520	00:06:48.860	positive way. My view is that this is a good
68	00:06:48.870	00:06:51.610	beginning. It's going to be a long path before we
69	00:06:51.620	00:06:55.320	have final passage, and I really believe that in the
70	00:06:55.330	00:06:59.070	past in most healthcare areas we could have bipartisanship. The
71	00:06:59.080	00:07:02.700	President said in his inaugural address that the best way
72	00:07:02.710	00:07:05.860	to fix what's wrong with America is to use what's
73	00:07:05.870	00:07:09.690	right with America. He's applied just the opposite of that
74	00:07:09.700	00:07:16.260	principle in his response to healthcare. Any American citizen thinks
75	00:07:16.270	00:07:18.510	that they will be made better off in their healthcare
76	00:07:18.520	00:07:23.440	security by a government-mismanaged program of this magnitude I think
77	00:07:23.450	00:07:26.490	is going to be badly misguided. Again, I could not
78	00:07:26.500	00:07:29.860	be more disappointed. The President speaks to the Congress at
79	00:07:29.870	00:07:32.770	9 PM Eastern Time, and we'll have more on healthcare
80	00:07:32.780	00:07:35.850	later in the program. Also today, Mr. Clinton said the
81	00:07:35.860	00:07:38.520	federal government would pay for 90 percent of the cost
82	00:07:38.530	00:07:41.920	of the summer's Midwest floods, instead of the usual 75
83	00:07:41.930	00:07:47.290	percent. Flood damage in the nine states totaled $7.6 billion.
84	00:07:47.300	00:07:49.290	In a written statement, the President said the floods had
85	00:07:49.300	00:07:53.610	shown that natural disasters can affect the entire nation's economy.
86	00:07:53.620	00:07:57.590	Gen. John Shalikashvili, President Clinton's nominee to the Chairman of
87	00:07:57.600	00:08:00.820	the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services
88	00:08:00.830	00:08:03.710	Committee today that he didn't learn of his father's World
89	00:08:03.720	00:08:08.250	War II Nazi affiliation until last month. After Mr. Clinton
90	00:08:08.260	00:08:10.920	named him to the post, reports surfaced that his father
91	00:08:10.930	00:08:15.170	had served in Nazi Germany's Vofen SS. It is most
92	00:08:15.180	00:08:20.170	troublesome to me that according to his own writings apparently
93	00:08:20.180	00:08:23.330	in the last months of the war, my father was
94	00:08:23.340	00:08:27.470	associated with some Georgian unit that was under the control
95	00:08:27.480	00:08:32.380	of the Vofen SS. I am deeply saddened that my
96	00:08:32.390	00:08:37.470	father had this tragic association. To me--and I believe
97	00:08:37.480	00:08:40.890	to all those who knew him--that is so absolutely
98	00:08:40.900	00:08:45.720	out of character. To me, he was a kind and
99	00:08:45.730	00:08:50.010	gentle man, and I loved him very much. He was
100	00:08:50.020	00:08:54.430	a man who perhaps loved his native Georgia too much,
101	00:08:54.440	00:08:57.000	certainly a man caught up in the awful tragedy of
102	00:08:57.010	00:09:01.730	World War II. Senators said the general's family wouldn't derail
103	00:09:01.740	00:09:07.000	his nomination. Meanwhile, Actress Jane Alexander began her confirmation hearings
104	00:09:07.010	00:09:09.440	today to be chairwoman of the National Endowment for the
105	00:09:09.450	00:09:13.680	Arts. Alexander told the committee she would follow the statutory
106	00:09:13.690	00:09:16.660	guidelines to ensure that grants are given to the highest
107	00:09:16.670	00:09:20.200	degree of artistic merit and excellence, but she said she
108	00:09:20.210	00:09:22.790	could not promise that the NEA would be free from
109	00:09:22.800	00:09:27.480	controversy. Jon Demjanjuk, the man cleared by Israel of being
110	00:09:27.490	00:09:30.910	Nazi Death Camp Guard "Ivan the Terrible," returned to Ohio
111	00:09:30.920	00:09:34.810	today and went into seclusion. The 73-year-old former auto worker
112	00:09:34.820	00:09:37.220	stopped in New York early this morning, where he was transferred
113	00:09:37.230	00:09:40.190	from an Israeli airliner to a plane chartered by his
114	00:09:40.200	00:09:43.800	family. Demjanjuk spent more than seven years in an Israeli
115	00:09:43.810	00:09:46.790	jail. The country's Supreme Court threw out his conviction in
116	00:09:46.800	00:09:49.440	July and then rejected requests for a new trial this
117	00:09:49.450	00:09:52.660	week. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno has said she will
118	00:09:52.670	00:09:56.990	move to deport him. The shuttle Discovery landed safely today
119	00:09:57.000	00:10:00.650	in the pre-dawn darkness at Florida's Kennedy Space Center. It
120	00:10:00.660	00:10:04.350	was the first ever nighttime landing at a space facility.
121	00:10:04.360	00:10:08.350	NASA officials said the 10-day mission was nearly flawless. The
122	00:10:08.360	00:10:11.800	five astronauts tested tools and techniques that a second crew
123	00:10:11.810	00:10:14.560	will use to try to fix the Hubble Space Telescope
124	00:10:14.570	00:10:18.770	in December. That ends our News Summary. Ahead on the
125	00:10:18.780	00:10:23.750	NewsHour, the standoff in Moscow, the Clinton healthcare speech, one
126	00:10:23.760	00:10:37.070	city's healthcare solution, and a Charlayne Hunter-Gault conversation. We go
127	00:10:37.080	00:10:39.710	first tonight to an update on the political crisis and
128	00:10:39.720	00:10:43.160	standoff in Russia. Russia now has two men claiming to
129	00:10:43.170	00:10:46.360	be president, and depending on which president you ask, has
130	00:10:46.370	00:10:49.690	either one parliament or no parliament at all. But Boris
131	00:10:49.700	00:10:52.140	Yeltsin seems to have held onto some key levers of
132	00:10:52.150	00:10:56.170	support. Our update comes from Correspondent Ian Williams of Independent
133	00:10:56.180	00:11:01.560	Television News. They surrounded the White House today, hardline demonstrators
134	00:11:01.570	00:11:06.100	behind their hastily erected barricades voicing their anger at President
135	00:11:06.110	00:11:10.160	Yeltsin and their support for the deputies inside. But this
136	00:11:10.170	00:11:13.250	was not the mass expression of popular outrage the Russian
137	00:11:13.260	00:11:16.240	parliament had called for. No more than a few hundred
138	00:11:16.250	00:11:20.340	turned up, greeting with cheers parliament's new threats against Yeltsin
139	00:11:20.350	00:11:25.550	and his government. The police kept their distance, the building
140	00:11:25.560	00:11:28.450	guarded by a group of men in plain clothes. They
141	00:11:28.460	00:11:32.950	were uneasy and suspicious, frog marching a Russian cameraman away
142	00:11:32.960	00:11:37.380	after he appeared not to cooperate with them. Inside, more
143	00:11:37.390	00:11:42.360	of these irregular guards, Kalashnikov rifles slung over their shoulders,
144	00:11:42.370	00:11:45.870	clearly not convinced by Yeltsin's assurance today that he will
145	00:11:45.880	00:11:50.900	not use force to solve the crisis. Three floors above,
146	00:11:50.910	00:11:54.350	the two men seeking to rest power away from Yeltsin.
147	00:11:54.360	00:11:58.840	Parliamentary Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov and the man appointed by parliament
148	00:11:58.850	00:12:04.160	as acting president, Alexander Rutskoi. We asked Mr. Khasbulatov what
149	00:12:04.170	00:12:12.300	he thought of the president's latest actions. The president, you
150	00:12:12.310	00:12:15.510	mean Rutskoi, well, I'm sure this president will do everything
151	00:12:15.520	00:12:21.680	in his power to normalize the situation. And how confident
152	00:12:21.690	00:12:26.540	was he that his president would win the power struggle?
153	00:12:26.550	00:12:29.570	The Russian people are already supporting us. This disgrace can't
154	00:12:29.580	00:12:31.960	possibly go on for a long time. There has to
155	00:12:31.970	00:12:34.420	be an end to it one way or another. And
156	00:12:34.430	00:12:38.540	Afghan war veteran, Mr. Rutskoi, likened the struggle for power
157	00:12:38.550	00:12:45.480	not to a battle but to a chess match. I'm
158	00:12:45.490	00:12:49.650	a pragmatic person. I'm always calculating. And if were to
159	00:12:49.660	00:12:51.860	call this a chess match and look two or three
160	00:12:51.870	00:12:54.910	steps ahead, we'd see that Yeltsin is in danger of
161	00:12:54.920	00:13:00.940	a checkmate, one or two moves and checkmate. One move
162	00:13:00.950	00:13:05.840	today for control of the media. Parliament, its long-distance telephones
163	00:13:05.850	00:13:09.940	cut by the president, demanded Rutskoi sack the pro-Yeltsin head
164	00:13:09.950	00:13:15.190	of state-controlled television and appoint his own man. News bulletins
165	00:13:15.200	00:13:18.610	have carried heavy coverage of the president's decree. They have
166	00:13:18.620	00:13:22.400	certainly been sympathetic to him though have also carried statements
167	00:13:22.410	00:13:26.730	from his opponents. The main television station is under heavy
168	00:13:26.740	00:13:35.560	police protection and remains in Yeltsin's hands. The media is
169	00:13:35.570	00:13:37.990	in the hands of the President's clique, if I may
170	00:13:38.000	00:13:40.650	call it such. The armed forces have been used to
171	00:13:40.660	00:13:43.650	put radio and TV under heavy guard. So what sort
172	00:13:43.660	00:13:49.320	of democracy is this? Most Russian newspapers, which now represent
173	00:13:49.330	00:13:52.470	a diverse range of opinions, have yet to comment in
174	00:13:52.480	00:13:56.640	detail on Yeltsin's decree, as last night's broadcasts came too
175	00:13:56.650	00:14:00.490	late for them. Another target of both sides, the defense
176	00:14:00.500	00:14:04.690	ministry. Last night, Rutskoi appointed his own defense and interior
177	00:14:04.700	00:14:07.750	ministers, but they have yet to get near their respective
178	00:14:07.760	00:14:13.110	ministries. Today, Yeltsin's defense minister, Havel Grachov, was meeting his
179	00:14:13.120	00:14:17.060	generals, a routine affair, he said. He also says the
180	00:14:17.070	00:14:21.070	armed forces would not become involved in any political actions,
181	00:14:21.080	00:14:24.990	though they fully support Boris Yeltsin, a statement of loyalty
182	00:14:25.000	00:14:30.050	echoed by Russia's interior minister. There was extra security around
183	00:14:30.060	00:14:35.010	public buildings today, but no sign of any troop deployment.
184	00:14:35.020	00:14:38.340	Parliament also ordered the country's central bank to stop funding
185	00:14:38.350	00:14:42.760	the presidential apparatus. Its leadership is conservative, but there is
186	00:14:42.770	00:14:47.230	no sign of them complying. And throughout Russian industry, where
187	00:14:47.240	00:14:51.490	discontent about reforms has been growing, workers were reluctant to
188	00:14:51.500	00:14:57.180	heed Khasbulatov's call to strike against Yeltsin. This afternoon, the
189	00:14:57.190	00:14:59.770	president appeared in public for the first time since his
190	00:14:59.780	00:15:03.310	announcement on a walkabout in Pushkin Square in the heart
191	00:15:03.320	00:15:07.800	of Moscow. He was, as always, brimming with confidence. "There
192	00:15:07.810	00:15:12.200	will be no negotiations with parliament because parliament doesn't exist
193	00:15:12.210	00:15:15.830	anymore," he declared. Buoyed by the news that so far
194	00:15:15.840	00:15:18.710	at least the armed forces have pledged their allegiance to
195	00:15:18.720	00:15:21.600	him, he told the people around him, "There will be
196	00:15:21.610	00:15:26.200	no blood on the streets," while Russia's other president appeared
197	00:15:26.210	00:15:28.830	on the balcony of the White House this evening to
198	00:15:28.840	00:15:32.100	address a gathering of his supporters, which by now have
199	00:15:32.110	00:15:40.150	swollen to several thousand. Here at the White House tonight
200	00:15:40.160	00:15:43.780	and among Yeltsin's supporters, there is a growing realization that
201	00:15:43.790	00:15:46.720	the outcome of this bitter struggle may not lie here
202	00:15:46.730	00:15:50.310	in Moscow but in the regions. Both sides have been
203	00:15:50.320	00:15:55.190	courting local leaders, and both are fearful that independence-minded republics
204	00:15:55.200	00:15:58.930	and regions may not take sides at all. Instead, they
205	00:15:58.940	00:16:12.270	may ignore central authority completely. Next tonight, the Clinton healthcare
206	00:16:12.280	00:16:15.760	plan. Later this evening, the President will formally present his
207	00:16:15.770	00:16:19.050	national healthcare plan to a joint session of Congress. The
208	00:16:19.060	00:16:21.950	long-heralded plan is at the heart of the President's domestic
209	00:16:21.960	00:16:25.950	policy. At stake is the reorganization of a $1 trillion
210	00:16:25.960	00:16:29.970	industry that accounts for one-seventh of the national economy. We
211	00:16:29.980	00:16:34.470	begin now with a Kwame Holman backgrounder. If any doubted
212	00:16:34.480	00:16:37.030	that health care would be a hot political issue in
213	00:16:37.040	00:16:41.070	the '90s, Harris Wofford probably made believers out of them.
214	00:16:41.080	00:16:47.310	Wofford! Wofford! During his 1991 campaign for a Pennsylvania Senate
215	00:16:47.320	00:16:50.990	seat, Wofford hammered away at the issue. He said people
216	00:16:51.000	00:16:54.180	who lose their jobs shouldn't lose their medical coverage as
217	00:16:54.190	00:16:58.670	well. Apparently, the voters agreed and swept Wofford to an
218	00:16:58.680	00:17:03.130	upset victory over Attorney General and former Pennsylvania Governor Richard
219	00:17:03.140	00:17:07.520	Thornburgh. We want national health insurance, and we want it
220	00:17:07.530	00:17:13.230	now! It was Wofford's political strategist, James Carville, who recognized
221	00:17:13.240	00:17:16.900	the importance of healthcare to the campaign, and when Carville
222	00:17:16.910	00:17:20.480	moved on to Bill Clinton's presidential campaign, so did the
223	00:17:20.490	00:17:24.790	healthcare issue. A healthcare program that will provide affordable healthcare
224	00:17:24.800	00:17:27.670	to all Americans but not by beginning with a huge
225	00:17:27.680	00:17:30.750	tax increase. By asking the wealthy to pay their fair
226	00:17:30.760	00:17:34.780	share, and controlling healthcare costs where the waste is most
227	00:17:34.790	00:17:38.820	flagrant among insurance companies and drug companies and bureaucracies. We
228	00:17:38.830	00:17:41.140	can keep what is best about our system, the right
229	00:17:41.150	00:17:44.050	to choose your doctor, your hospital, your provider. We can
230	00:17:44.060	00:17:47.520	keep the whole thing private, including insurance. And we must
231	00:17:47.530	00:17:50.780	require people not to be denied access to health coverage
232	00:17:50.790	00:17:55.610	because of preexisting conditions. Candidate Clinton vowed to make healthcare
233	00:17:55.620	00:17:59.890	reform the No. 1 priority of his administration. And shortly
234	00:17:59.900	00:18:03.290	after he was sworn in to office, President Clinton underscored
235	00:18:03.300	00:18:06.890	his campaign pledge by appointing First Lady Hillary to head
236	00:18:06.900	00:18:10.890	the White House task force on healthcare reform. I think
237	00:18:10.900	00:18:13.760	that in the coming months the American people will learn,
238	00:18:13.770	00:18:16.440	as the people of our state did, that we have
239	00:18:16.450	00:18:19.310	a First Lady of many talents but who, most of
240	00:18:19.320	00:18:24.000	all, can bring people together around complex and difficult issues
241	00:18:24.010	00:18:27.890	to hammer out consensus and get things done. In the
242	00:18:27.900	00:18:31.130	weeks and months that followed, Hillary Rodham Clinton held a
243	00:18:31.140	00:18:35.560	number of high-profile town meetings and healthcare forums. She invited
244	00:18:35.570	00:18:39.440	healthcare professionals, as well as everyday Americans, to give their
245	00:18:39.450	00:18:42.860	opinions and advice on what needed to be contained in
246	00:18:42.870	00:18:47.250	any healthcare reform package. Many of the problems that were
247	00:18:47.260	00:18:49.530	pointed out that we could all agree on, that we
248	00:18:49.540	00:18:53.570	don't have enough primary care practitioners to do the kind
249	00:18:53.580	00:18:55.310	of work that we heard about from the doctor in
250	00:18:55.320	00:18:57.690	the audience and the doctor in the panel. Well, how
251	00:18:57.700	00:19:01.030	do we get quickly to reverse the ratio of 70
252	00:19:01.040	00:19:04.880	percent specialists to 30 percent generalists? I don't know that
253	00:19:04.890	00:19:08.070	it is possible to satisfy every need that was heard
254	00:19:08.080	00:19:11.210	today. I think the best we can do is to
255	00:19:11.220	00:19:13.970	be honest about facing the problems that every one of
256	00:19:13.980	00:19:16.070	us in this room have had a hand in helping
257	00:19:16.080	00:19:21.290	to create. Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States.
258	00:19:21.300	00:19:24.530	Tonight, will be President Clinton's second address to a joint
259	00:19:24.540	00:19:27.800	session of Congress. He's expected to lay out the principles
260	00:19:27.810	00:19:32.340	of healthcare reform he wants met, including health security for
261	00:19:32.350	00:19:37.910	all, simplifying the healthcare system, making sure everybody pays a
262	00:19:37.920	00:19:43.500	fair share, and achieving savings through cost containment, while maintaining
263	00:19:43.510	00:19:47.660	choice and the quality of care. And what the President
264	00:19:47.670	00:19:50.580	does not want is the kind of partisan battle that
265	00:19:50.590	00:19:55.460	ensued after his first speech to Congress on the budget.
266	00:19:55.470	00:19:58.390	Mrs. Clinton has kept closely in touch with members of
267	00:19:58.400	00:20:02.290	Congress from both parties, and it appears a bipartisan spirit
268	00:20:02.300	00:20:06.720	is there. I really feel that on this issue, one
269	00:20:06.730	00:20:10.100	that has all kinds of interest among the American people
270	00:20:10.110	00:20:13.750	out there, that we can definitely work together, and there
271	00:20:13.760	00:20:16.770	are a number of options for us to consider. One
272	00:20:16.780	00:20:20.040	of those options was offered by Senate Minority Leader Bob
273	00:20:20.050	00:20:23.640	Dole. Fundamentally, we believe that if you give business men
274	00:20:23.650	00:20:26.760	and women and individuals the tools they need to gain
275	00:20:26.770	00:20:30.790	access to reasonably priced healthcare coverage, they will take that
276	00:20:30.800	00:20:35.870	opportunity, absent massive government intervention or mandates. As the President
277	00:20:35.880	00:20:39.080	prepared this afternoon to deliver tonight's address, it was with
278	00:20:39.090	00:20:42.170	the knowledge that no matter what specifics he presents, the
279	00:20:42.180	00:20:46.430	details of healthcare reform will be worked out by Congress.
280	00:20:46.440	00:20:49.400	Now, two officials who've dealt with health issues in previous
281	00:20:49.410	00:20:53.600	administrations. Dr. Bernadine Healy was director of the National Institutes
282	00:20:53.610	00:20:57.300	of Health under President Bush. She's currently seeking the Republican
283	00:20:57.310	00:21:01.430	nomination for the U.S. Senate for Ohio. Joseph Califano was
284	00:21:01.440	00:21:05.110	Secretary of Health, Education, & Welfare under President Carter. He
285	00:21:05.120	00:21:09.450	also served as chief domestic adviser to President Johnson. Welcome
286	00:21:09.460	00:21:11.480	to both of you. Let me start with you, Mr.
287	00:21:11.490	00:21:14.440	Califano. What does the President have to do tonight? What's
288	00:21:14.450	00:21:17.080	the most important case he has to make? Well, I
289	00:21:17.090	00:21:19.340	think the case is made for healthcare reform. What he's
290	00:21:19.350	00:21:22.730	got to do is really give a speech that keeps
291	00:21:22.740	00:21:25.170	this subject on the front burner. I think the President's
292	00:21:25.180	00:21:28.590	role is to arouse the people to a call to
293	00:21:28.600	00:21:31.300	arms. The bill is going to be written in Congress.
294	00:21:31.310	00:21:34.050	The details of this bill will be written in Congress.
295	00:21:34.060	00:21:37.080	And I think he's done it brilliantly so far. And
296	00:21:37.090	00:21:42.290	I think he's played on the greatest concern of the
297	00:21:42.300	00:21:45.990	American people. Most American people have healthcare, but they're all
298	00:21:46.000	00:21:48.590	worried about losing it when they lose their jobs. With
299	00:21:48.600	00:21:51.030	thousands of layoffs in the past couple of years, with
300	00:21:51.040	00:21:54.970	business, big business angry that other big business isn't covering
301	00:21:54.980	00:21:58.330	their employees, he's played on all of that very well.
302	00:21:58.340	00:22:01.280	And I think the people are ready for reform. Do
303	00:22:01.290	00:22:03.430	you agree, Dr. Healy? I think the most important thing
304	00:22:03.440	00:22:06.680	he should do tonight is to make sense and not
305	00:22:06.690	00:22:09.370	to incite fear. I think fear has been a driving
306	00:22:09.380	00:22:10.910	force in this debate, and I don't think it's a
307	00:22:10.920	00:22:14.070	healthy one. I think facts, not fear, should dominate, and
308	00:22:14.080	00:22:20.100	facts have to be surrounded--surrounding the issues, affordability, coverage
309	00:22:20.110	00:22:23.800	of those 37 million who are not covered, and some
310	00:22:23.810	00:22:26.620	recognition of the fact that over 200 million Americans are
311	00:22:26.630	00:22:29.110	getting good care and don't necessarily have to have their
312	00:22:29.120	00:22:33.140	whole care disassembled in order to help the 37 million
313	00:22:33.150	00:22:36.170	who do need coverage. Well, Mr. Califano, where do you
314	00:22:36.180	00:22:39.990	think the President starts at with the public? That is,
315	00:22:40.000	00:22:43.400	the polls seem quite contradictory. 90 percent of the people
316	00:22:43.410	00:22:45.680	say they like their own healthcare, but 90 percent of
317	00:22:45.690	00:22:47.600	the people tell the New York Times they want the
318	00:22:47.610	00:22:50.680	system drastically overhauled. Well, I think most of the people
319	00:22:50.690	00:22:53.420	love healthcare, and they love not paying for it. And
320	00:22:53.430	00:22:56.070	they feel like they're not paying for it. I think,
321	00:22:56.080	00:22:59.980	where does he start? He starts where Richard Nixon arrived,
322	00:22:59.990	00:23:02.120	where Jimmy Carter and I arrived. When I started looking
323	00:23:02.130	00:23:04.780	at healthcare on a search of HEW, I was all--
324	00:23:04.790	00:23:06.880	I started with the viewpoint of a national plan, with
325	00:23:06.890	00:23:09.270	the federal government running it. But the reality is that
326	00:23:09.280	00:23:12.890	every nation in the world that covers all their people,
327	00:23:12.900	00:23:16.240	we're the only industrialized nation besides South Africa that doesn't,
328	00:23:16.250	00:23:19.080	every nation did it out of their existing healthcare system.
329	00:23:19.090	00:23:21.680	So he starts with the employer mandate. Like it or
330	00:23:21.690	00:23:24.280	not, the reality is that most Americans get their healthcare
331	00:23:24.290	00:23:27.790	from their employment relationship. And there, I think, we ought
332	00:23:27.800	00:23:31.440	to treat it like the minimum wage. Minimum healthcare benefits
333	00:23:31.450	00:23:35.800	like a minimum wage, like disability insurance, like unemployment insurance.
334	00:23:35.810	00:23:37.620	These are things that employers have paid for in this
335	00:23:37.630	00:23:40.020	country, and the arguments you hear about not having a
336	00:23:40.030	00:23:43.910	mandate really resonate with the arguments that people made in
337	00:23:43.920	00:23:47.300	the 1930s against the 25 cent minimum wage when that
338	00:23:47.310	00:23:50.040	was proposed. And I think that'll happen. It will be
339	00:23:50.050	00:23:52.440	phased in over several years, but I think that piece
340	00:23:52.450	00:23:55.190	will be done. Dr. Healy, do you agree that the
341	00:23:55.200	00:23:58.040	employer mandate--by that we mean most coverage will come
342	00:23:58.050	00:24:01.660	through the employers--was politically in any event the only
343	00:24:01.670	00:24:03.550	way he could go? No, I don't think so. I
344	00:24:03.560	00:24:05.400	think that what you really have to do is look
345	00:24:05.410	00:24:07.550	at the people who are uninsured, tease them out, and
346	00:24:07.560	00:24:11.090	find out how we can design tailored programs for people.
347	00:24:11.100	00:24:14.420	60 percent of them are young people who simply don't
348	00:24:14.430	00:24:16.860	want to be burdened with a price tag of two
349	00:24:16.870	00:24:19.590	thousand, four thousand dollars, when they're never going to consume
350	00:24:19.600	00:24:21.950	that much cost in a year. So I think there
351	00:24:21.960	00:24:24.940	are ways that we could have individual mandates that give
352	00:24:24.950	00:24:28.430	the individual patient more responsibility and more control over a
353	00:24:28.440	00:24:30.170	large amount of money that's going to be spent per
354	00:24:30.180	00:24:34.770	capita. There's a very deep feeling of paternalism among this
355	00:24:34.780	00:24:37.940	plan that says people can't handle their healthcare for themselves,
356	00:24:37.950	00:24:40.370	we're going to seize and control it, tell them what
357	00:24:40.380	00:24:42.360	they can do, what they can't do. It's a "one
358	00:24:42.370	00:24:45.740	size fits all" approach. And I think Joe knows that
359	00:24:45.750	00:24:48.390	back 20 years ago we were all toying with national
360	00:24:48.400	00:24:51.250	health insurance, but a lot of social experimentation has gone
361	00:24:51.260	00:24:53.420	on around the world which has shown that national health
362	00:24:53.430	00:24:56.600	insurance leads to long waiting lines. It does not lead
363	00:24:56.610	00:25:01.020	to efficiencies, and worst of all, it is a failure,
364	00:25:01.030	00:25:02.900	judged by the fact that most of those countries are
365	00:25:02.910	00:25:05.290	starting to privatize. Let me go back just though to
366	00:25:05.300	00:25:07.860	the politics of the situation right now. What kind of
367	00:25:07.870	00:25:09.860	a job do you think President and Mrs. Clinton have
368	00:25:09.870	00:25:13.480	done so far in trying to get different constituency groups
369	00:25:13.490	00:25:16.390	behind this? To date, I think they've done a remarkable
370	00:25:16.400	00:25:18.410	job. I will tell you, and I have said it
371	00:25:18.420	00:25:21.190	publicly, six months ago, I thought there was no prayer
372	00:25:21.200	00:25:24.650	of having a major reform by the end of 1994.
373	00:25:24.660	00:25:27.330	I think now the chances are better than 50/50. I'd
374	00:25:27.340	00:25:30.470	make one point, the emphasis on the employment relationship is
375	00:25:30.480	00:25:33.170	important because of when you look at those thirty-seven to
376	00:25:33.180	00:25:36.230	forty million people, two-thirds of them work, or are dependents
377	00:25:36.240	00:25:39.590	of workers. And if you're Chrysler, or you're in the
378	00:25:39.600	00:25:42.960	steel industry, or you're IBM, or you're Kodak, your blood
379	00:25:42.970	00:25:45.170	is boiling if you're running those companies when you look
380	00:25:45.180	00:25:51.070	at retailers and fast food companies and hotel chains, big
381	00:25:51.080	00:25:55.190	multimillion dollar corporations that don't cover their employees. So that
382	00:25:55.200	00:25:57.680	piece, the quickest way to knock off a big piece
383	00:25:57.690	00:26:00.660	of that is to mandate. But I think in the
384	00:26:00.670	00:26:03.350	basic question, they've done it very well, gone around the
385	00:26:03.360	00:26:09.860	country. They have cobbled together a remarkable array of ideas.
386	00:26:09.870	00:26:12.500	And I think when you look at the 229-page plan,
387	00:26:12.510	00:26:16.320	it's really more of a big barrel of ideas than
388	00:26:16.330	00:26:19.520	it is a plan that dots every "i" and crosses
389	00:26:19.530	00:26:21.660	every "t." And there, I mean, I give them A+
390	00:26:21.670	00:26:23.640	for this, I mean, much better than I ever thought
391	00:26:23.650	00:26:26.860	they could do. And I think Mrs. Clinton has been
392	00:26:26.870	00:26:30.980	remarkable because she's learned so much. I met with her,
393	00:26:30.990	00:26:34.560	for example, on, on covering substance abuse and the importance
394	00:26:34.570	00:26:37.740	of covering substance abuse, which Dr. Healy, I think, shares.
395	00:26:37.750	00:26:39.110	In one way or another we've got to deal with
396	00:26:39.120	00:26:43.050	that problem. She was remarkable. She asked all the tough
397	00:26:43.060	00:26:45.600	questions. She asked us to put together the best people
398	00:26:45.610	00:26:48.850	in the country to put treatment programs together. We did.
399	00:26:48.860	00:26:51.120	We gave them a package. I don't think they've adopted
400	00:26:51.130	00:26:53.500	every bit of it, but they've taken, they've recognized you've
401	00:26:53.510	00:26:56.080	got to cut, you can't have healthcare reform in this
402	00:26:56.090	00:26:58.980	country without doing something about substance abuse. I think they've
403	00:26:58.990	00:27:02.110	done a good job so far. Dr. Healy, do you
404	00:27:02.120	00:27:05.560	think that she has brought the Republicans along? Where--how
405	00:27:05.570	00:27:07.060	do you think the Republicans on the Hill are going
406	00:27:07.070	00:27:09.330	to play this? First, I think that there is no
407	00:27:09.340	00:27:12.470	question that both of the Clintons have done a magnificent
408	00:27:12.480	00:27:15.460	job in making healthcare finally a front burner issue. I
409	00:27:15.470	00:27:18.530	think every American has focused on this issue, and I
410	00:27:18.540	00:27:21.660	do believe it has to be a nonpartisan issue. But
411	00:27:21.670	00:27:24.990	that does not mean that there isn't a very strong
412	00:27:25.000	00:27:29.170	threat of political philosophy that is inherent in the approach
413	00:27:29.180	00:27:32.190	to healthcare solutions. And I think that the Democrats traditionally
414	00:27:32.200	00:27:34.600	think the solution is bigger and bigger government and more
415	00:27:34.610	00:27:37.930	and more taxes, and I think the Republican political philosophy
416	00:27:37.940	00:27:41.700	is smaller government and more empowerment of individual people. Let
417	00:27:41.710	00:27:44.420	taxpayers manage their own money. But, I mean, as a
418	00:27:44.430	00:27:46.980	practical matter, how do you think Republicans are going to
419	00:27:46.990	00:27:49.020	play it here? They don't have the votes to pass
420	00:27:49.030	00:27:51.170	their own plan. What do you think is going to
421	00:27:51.180	00:27:54.940	be important to them, to Republicans, in making changes to
422	00:27:54.950	00:27:58.000	the plan, which Mrs. Clinton has indicated an openness to
423	00:27:58.010	00:28:00.170	do? Well, I think the most important thing is to
424	00:28:00.180	00:28:03.610	work in a constructive way focusing on the people who
425	00:28:03.620	00:28:07.980	are uninsured and not trying a massive social experiment with
426	00:28:07.990	00:28:11.930	over 250 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are adequately
427	00:28:11.940	00:28:15.010	covered. I think that the strategy of the Republicans is
428	00:28:15.020	00:28:18.140	going to have to be to focus on the job
429	00:28:18.150	00:28:20.610	that needs to be done and not to buy into
430	00:28:20.620	00:28:23.920	a massive restructuring of the entire healthcare system in this
431	00:28:23.930	00:28:28.760	country which has economic consequences, as well as human consequences.
432	00:28:28.770	00:28:31.210	Please. Can I just--the issue I don't think is
433	00:28:31.220	00:28:34.570	a Democratic/Republican issue. I think Republicans and Democrats will split
434	00:28:34.580	00:28:37.110	all over the lot. I think the politics of this
435	00:28:37.120	00:28:41.360	issue is one trillion dollars, and it's on the side
436	00:28:41.370	00:28:44.030	of the people that are paying. The federal government's paying.
437	00:28:44.040	00:28:46.610	The states are paying. The cities are paying. Business is
438	00:28:46.620	00:28:49.890	paying, and individuals are paying. They're going to fight over
439	00:28:49.900	00:28:53.080	not paying any more or paying less. On the side
440	00:28:53.090	00:28:55.530	of the people that are getting the trillion dollars, the
441	00:28:55.540	00:29:00.490	health insurance companies, the HMOs, the doctors, the hospitals, the
442	00:29:00.500	00:29:05.450	medical equipment manufacturers, the pharmaceutical companies, the hospital unions, the
443	00:29:05.460	00:29:08.030	nurses, they're going to fight over hanging on to their
444	00:29:08.040	00:29:10.300	piece of the pie. And I don't think this problem
445	00:29:10.310	00:29:13.890	will break in Congress between Republicans and Democrats. I think
446	00:29:13.900	00:29:16.820	it's going to break among those interest groups. And I've
447	00:29:16.830	00:29:20.130	often said I wish the President had been able to
448	00:29:20.140	00:29:24.120	get campaign finance reform through before the healthcare bill went
449	00:29:24.130	00:29:27.320	up because the buckets of money that will pour in
450	00:29:27.330	00:29:29.730	and already are pouring into Capitol Hill, this is the
451	00:29:29.740	00:29:33.470	way this issue will break politically. I think there still
452	00:29:33.480	00:29:36.860	is a core issue that's very polar, and that is,
453	00:29:36.870	00:29:39.500	is the solution going to be government telling you what
454	00:29:39.510	00:29:41.140	to do about your healthcare, or is it going to
455	00:29:41.150	00:29:45.390	be the individual making choices? And, remember, remember, it was
456	00:29:45.400	00:29:47.730	the President and the Vice President who were all over
457	00:29:47.740	00:29:50.000	this country just a few weeks ago telling us that
458	00:29:50.010	00:29:53.260	the government needed to be reinvented. There's a mammoth intellectual
459	00:29:53.270	00:29:57.680	inconsistency in seeing that government inefficiencies with $50 to fill
460	00:29:57.690	00:30:00.290	out one form, which is why government needs to be
461	00:30:00.300	00:30:04.090	reinvented, that same bureaucracy is going to seize 15 percent
462	00:30:04.100	00:30:07.080	of our economy and take over the healthcare of 250
463	00:30:07.090	00:30:10.970	million Americans. That's the core issue. I would urge everybody
464	00:30:10.980	00:30:13.410	to go back and read Richard Nixon's message to Congress
465	00:30:13.420	00:30:17.060	in 1971 and his message to Congress in 1972. What
466	00:30:17.070	00:30:20.550	did he say? He said we need an employer mandate,
467	00:30:20.560	00:30:22.690	and he said, we need more HMOs so we get
468	00:30:22.700	00:30:26.410	people into more efficient healthcare systems. But that's the core
469	00:30:26.420	00:30:29.400	of what Bill Clinton is saying. That's exactly what Jimmy
470	00:30:29.410	00:30:32.060	Carter said. After we looked for about two and a
471	00:30:32.070	00:30:34.590	half years at every alternative, we ended up in the
472	00:30:34.600	00:30:37.400	same place. Okay. That raises a question. All these other
473	00:30:37.410	00:30:42.960	countries, all these industrialized countries have healthcare. Explain why, one,
474	00:30:42.970	00:30:45.590	we don't have any national healthcare, but two, why it's
475	00:30:45.600	00:30:47.780	going to be so much more difficult here than it
476	00:30:47.790	00:30:49.840	was in Europe to get this? We don't have it
477	00:30:49.850	00:30:52.410	I think in part because of something Dr. Healy said,
478	00:30:52.420	00:30:56.210	which is most Americans have healthcare, and there is, there
479	00:30:56.220	00:30:59.430	is a safety net out there. We forget, people that
480	00:30:59.440	00:31:02.170	really get sick or really get hurt get healthcare, they
481	00:31:02.180	00:31:05.000	get it in the most inefficient way, in emergency rooms
482	00:31:05.010	00:31:08.900	of Cleveland Clinic, and elsewhere, and what have you, so
483	00:31:08.910	00:31:12.460	it's there. And the second thing is, in this country
484	00:31:12.470	00:31:17.300	now, I mean, healthcare is almost America's biggest business. It
485	00:31:17.310	00:31:20.410	is the only industry in the country where hundreds of
486	00:31:20.420	00:31:25.050	thousands of jobs were created during the 1990/91 recession, and
487	00:31:25.060	00:31:30.000	there this is as high stakes as political poker gets
488	00:31:30.010	00:31:32.480	in the Congress of the United States. Whereas, of course,
489	00:31:32.490	00:31:35.540	when it was instituted in European Countries, healthcare might be
490	00:31:35.550	00:31:37.400	2 or 3 percent of the GDP. It wasn't a
491	00:31:37.410	00:31:41.490	huge--just take Britain, for example. First of all, it's
492	00:31:41.500	00:31:43.790	a very small percentage but also all they did, people
493	00:31:43.800	00:31:47.480	say, oh, it's socialism. But Britons aren't socialists. What happened
494	00:31:47.490	00:31:50.680	was the voluntary hospital system in Great Britain had broken
495	00:31:50.690	00:31:52.820	down during World War II, and the government was running
496	00:31:52.830	00:31:55.600	every hospital. Every doctor and nurse was in the military,
497	00:31:55.610	00:31:59.010	on the government payroll. They just legislated the existing situation
498	00:31:59.020	00:32:02.780	in 1945. That's what they have done. Incidentally, I will
499	00:32:02.790	00:32:06.730	share one thing. I think Bernadine makes one important point.
500	00:32:06.740	00:32:10.100	The cost part of this equation, the rising healthcare part
501	00:32:10.110	00:32:15.140	of this equation exists in every country in the world.
502	00:32:15.150	00:32:18.220	It's different here because doctors are paid more here, but
503	00:32:18.230	00:32:19.900	we also have a lot of problems. When you look
504	00:32:19.910	00:32:25.650	at Canada, we have AIDS in a way and substance
505	00:32:25.660	00:32:27.700	abuse and violence in a way that other countries don't
506	00:32:27.710	00:32:30.130	have it. Sadly, we're almost out of time for such
507	00:32:30.140	00:32:32.030	a complicated issue. Let me end with one question. And
508	00:32:32.040	00:32:35.260	I'll start with you. Right now, we spend 14 percent
509	00:32:35.270	00:32:38.010	of our GDP on healthcare. The Clintons hope to hold
510	00:32:38.020	00:32:40.720	to 17 percent by the year 2000. Can a modern
511	00:32:40.730	00:32:44.890	society be economically healthy spending just that much on healthcare
512	00:32:44.900	00:32:48.930	for its citizens? Does it make sense? Well, I think
513	00:32:48.940	00:32:52.230	it is expensive, it's good value, but it cannot continue
514	00:32:52.240	00:32:54.640	to rise at the rate it's been rising. Everyone agrees.
515	00:32:54.650	00:32:56.860	That's where I think there is consensus across the board,
516	00:32:56.870	00:32:58.820	and I think some of the positive aspects of the
517	00:32:58.830	00:33:01.810	Hilton--of the Clinton health plan is that it does
518	00:33:01.820	00:33:05.310	talk about administrative inefficiencies, it talks about a universal health
519	00:33:05.320	00:33:07.990	insurance form, which will be a blessing for everyone, would
520	00:33:08.000	00:33:11.820	probably save billions of dollars. It talks about tort reform.
521	00:33:11.830	00:33:16.650	It also talks about tax deductibility for premiums of people
522	00:33:16.660	00:33:18.890	who are self-insured. So there are a lot of elements
523	00:33:18.900	00:33:20.700	in there that will help to drive down the cost
524	00:33:20.710	00:33:22.750	of care, but we have to be careful that when
525	00:33:22.760	00:33:27.220	we speak about making healthcare cost efficient that we take
526	00:33:27.230	00:33:29.540	out the fat and don't cut into the bones and
527	00:33:29.550	00:33:33.610	the muscles because America is not ready to say no
528	00:33:33.620	00:33:36.870	to transplantation, to kidney dialysis, as many countries around the
529	00:33:36.880	00:33:39.540	world do. America's not ready to say, we're not going
530	00:33:39.550	00:33:42.290	to save that baby who's only a thousand grams. Other
531	00:33:42.300	00:33:46.640	countries do. Mr. Califano. I think--I mean, I think
532	00:33:46.650	00:33:50.050	we can hold the rate, the proportion of GNP, but
533	00:33:50.060	00:33:52.710	let's not be unrealistic. Healthcare costs are going to rise.
534	00:33:52.720	00:33:54.410	What we're talking about is the rate of increase. You're
535	00:33:54.420	00:33:56.890	not going to bring 40 million people--you know, it's
536	00:33:56.900	00:33:58.800	not going to be good for my father, my mother,
537	00:33:58.810	00:34:01.150	my wife, or my child--into this system and keep
538	00:34:01.160	00:34:04.470	the cost the same. And I think we have recognize
539	00:34:04.480	00:34:06.510	and be realistic about that. I think we can hold
540	00:34:06.520	00:34:09.970	them. I think that in terms of, of the big
541	00:34:09.980	00:34:13.980	ticket items, cultural changes, like the way people think about
542	00:34:13.990	00:34:15.760	dying, whether they want to be tied up to tubes
543	00:34:15.770	00:34:17.660	or be at home, will have a greater impact than
544	00:34:17.670	00:34:20.530	any of the law or regulation those people are writing.
545	00:34:20.540	00:34:23.010	Well, thank you both very much. And we'll welcome you
546	00:34:23.020	00:34:26.310	back to watch the speech together. Thanks, Roger. Over to
547	00:34:26.320	00:34:38.000	you, Roger. Next, we look at one health reform model
548	00:34:38.010	00:34:41.000	that is already up and running. The city of Rochester,
549	00:34:41.010	00:34:43.770	New York, has a unique healthcare system that President Clinton
550	00:34:43.780	00:34:47.520	has praised as worth learning from. Medical Correspondent Fred De
551	00:34:47.530	00:34:51.180	Sam Lazaro has this report on the Rochester system. It
552	00:34:51.190	00:34:55.630	first aired on the NewsHour in February. For 21-year-old Jason
553	00:34:55.640	00:34:58.420	Bowman, it's been an arduous journey back to a normal
554	00:34:58.430	00:35:02.270	routine two years after it was interrupted by a severe
555	00:35:02.280	00:35:10.870	car accident. And I fractured my C-6/C-7 vertebrae, which left
556	00:35:10.880	00:35:13.310	me paralyzed. And that was the only thing that happened
557	00:35:13.320	00:35:18.460	actually was a broken neck, and I didn't suffer any
558	00:35:18.470	00:35:22.510	broken bones or legs. It was a whiplash kind of
559	00:35:22.520	00:35:26.260	an injury? Yes. Hearing the word "quadriplegic," when you know
560	00:35:26.270	00:35:33.410	what it means is pretty devastating, and so you know
561	00:35:33.420	00:35:36.380	that you're in for--you're going to be locked into
562	00:35:36.390	00:35:39.380	the healthcare system for quite a while. Given that grim
563	00:35:39.390	00:35:42.500	diagnosis, Jim and Barbara Bowman say their son has made
564	00:35:42.510	00:35:46.650	a remarkable recovery, which they attribute to a ferocious spirit
565	00:35:46.660	00:35:50.940	and superb but expensive medical care. Jason's medical bills have
566	00:35:50.950	00:35:54.010	neared a quarter of a million dollars. Almost all of
567	00:35:54.020	00:35:59.640	it was covered under his parents' insurance policy. The Bowmans
568	00:35:59.650	00:36:03.200	run a veterinary hospital with eight employees. In most of
569	00:36:03.210	00:36:06.510	the U.S. Jason's bills would have jacked up the premiums
570	00:36:06.520	00:36:09.840	on their group health insurance. That's not the case here
571	00:36:09.850	00:36:13.100	in Rochester, New York. We pay the same premiums that
572	00:36:13.110	00:36:16.440	anyone else pays. We've had rate increases, but they're across-the-board
573	00:36:16.450	00:36:21.030	and according to whatever the overall increase in healthcare is
574	00:36:21.040	00:36:23.510	for the area. He hasn't been singled out in any
575	00:36:23.520	00:36:27.940	way, as we can see, because of what he's cost
576	00:36:27.950	00:36:30.930	the system or because of his injury or because he
577	00:36:30.940	00:36:33.640	will be an ongoing burden to the system. Here in
578	00:36:33.650	00:36:36.870	Rochester those premiums are about a third less than anywhere
579	00:36:36.880	00:36:39.980	else in the U.S. As a result, only 6 percent
580	00:36:39.990	00:36:44.010	of Rochester's citizens do not carry insurance, far fewer than
581	00:36:44.020	00:36:48.740	the 14 percent on average nationally who are uninsured. Four
582	00:36:48.750	00:36:54.000	factors account for Rochester's relatively high access and affordability: One
583	00:36:54.010	00:36:57.370	insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, has a virtual monopoly in
584	00:36:57.380	00:37:01.030	the city; there is little overlap in the services healthcare
585	00:37:01.040	00:37:05.990	facilities provide; the insurer and healthcare providers set fees after
586	00:37:06.000	00:37:10.230	tough bargaining; and no one is denied insurance coverage, not
587	00:37:10.240	00:37:13.910	even the sick. Their insurance premiums are determined by a
588	00:37:13.920	00:37:21.320	mechanism known as community rating. In other words, the risk
589	00:37:21.330	00:37:24.240	of covering a Jason Bowman is spread over the entire
590	00:37:24.250	00:37:29.480	community of 230,000, not just the veterinary clinic group. It's
591	00:37:29.490	00:37:32.730	a system that like everything else in Rochester, it seems,
592	00:37:32.740	00:37:39.280	has its origins in the giant Eastman Kodak Corporation. Kodak
593	00:37:39.290	00:37:43.370	employs 40,000 people in Rochester. It's been a huge business
594	00:37:43.380	00:37:47.530	here and a philanthropic, even paternalistic presence since its founding
595	00:37:47.540	00:37:52.510	in the late 1800s by George Eastman. Early on as
596	00:37:52.520	00:37:57.340	healthcare began to become more and more expensive, he began
597	00:37:57.350	00:38:02.190	to look for ways of helping Kodak people prepare for
598	00:38:02.200	00:38:08.760	that, and that led to work in this community to
599	00:38:08.770	00:38:13.670	institute one of the very early insurance arrangements around hospital
600	00:38:13.680	00:38:18.010	care. Early medical insurance policies were priced according to community-wide
601	00:38:18.020	00:38:21.120	risk, but starting in the '30s as the health insurance
602	00:38:21.130	00:38:26.300	industry grew, the market became fragmented. Insurers offered big employers
603	00:38:26.310	00:38:30.580	discounts in exchange for their volume business, forming groups separate
604	00:38:30.590	00:38:35.570	from the community. What's left in the risk pool are
605	00:38:35.580	00:38:40.940	self-employed individuals or small businesses, like car dealerships. With indeterminate
606	00:38:40.950	00:38:44.400	risks, they are forced to pay higher premiums. They're also
607	00:38:44.410	00:38:48.770	subject to exclusion based on medical history, an insurance tactic
608	00:38:48.780	00:38:53.350	known as "cherry picking." In Rochester, however, spokesman David Edwards
609	00:38:53.360	00:38:56.520	says Kodak asked its insurer to stick with the community
610	00:38:56.530	00:39:00.700	rating system. We are, in effect, pooling with the large
611	00:39:00.710	00:39:05.880	numbers of small businesses and individuals. In fact, in this
612	00:39:05.890	00:39:09.190	community an individual can walk in off the street and,
613	00:39:09.200	00:39:12.880	in effect, pay the same price that Kodak pays for
614	00:39:12.890	00:39:17.490	healthcare. And it's more expensive to do that, so what
615	00:39:17.500	00:39:21.580	we wind up doing, in effect, is subsidizing to some
616	00:39:21.590	00:39:26.660	extent the administration and management of the care for those
617	00:39:26.670	00:39:30.250	groups. One reason Rochester is able to have a community
618	00:39:30.260	00:39:34.320	rating system is the city virtually has one insurance company,
619	00:39:34.330	00:39:37.370	Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rochester. You do have a
620	00:39:37.380	00:39:40.380	copy of the claim that you submitted? Kodak has long
621	00:39:40.390	00:39:44.620	given its insurance business exclusively to the Blues. Other employers
622	00:39:44.630	00:39:49.230	have followed suit, essentially sharing in Kodak's volume discount, giving
623	00:39:49.240	00:39:52.490	Blue Cross Blue Shield a near monopoly in Rochester and
624	00:39:52.500	00:39:56.860	keeping out the so-called "cherry picker" competitors. Howard Berman is
625	00:39:56.870	00:40:01.750	Blue Cross Blue Shield's chief executive officer. Large employers play
626	00:40:01.760	00:40:08.210	a--historically have played a remarkably important role, and particularly
627	00:40:08.220	00:40:11.770	the Eastman Kodak Company. We, however, at Blue Cross Blue
628	00:40:11.780	00:40:17.930	Shield have over 6,000 accounts, 6,000 businesses that buy health
629	00:40:17.940	00:40:22.160	insurance through us. Those businesses and Blue Cross Blue Shield
630	00:40:22.170	00:40:25.960	form a powerful coalition with a long history of negotiating
631	00:40:25.970	00:40:29.450	with doctors and hospitals to establish fees and keep costs
632	00:40:29.460	00:40:33.990	down. The results are readily evident. There's been no addition
633	00:40:34.000	00:40:38.680	to Rochester's hospital capacity since the 1960s in sharp contrast
634	00:40:38.690	00:40:45.250	to national trends. Today while hospitals nationwide are closing or
635	00:40:45.260	00:40:50.140	merging, Rochester's eight facilities are typically ninety, sometimes one hundred
636	00:40:50.150	00:40:55.090	percent occupied. Because they're all nearly full, hospitals cooperate more
637	00:40:55.100	00:40:58.340	than compete with each other. There is little duplication of
638	00:40:58.350	00:41:03.000	services. Radiologist Derace Schaffer says the big emphasis on cost
639	00:41:03.010	00:41:07.110	control means innovation and new technology come to Rochester much
640	00:41:07.120	00:41:10.720	later than other cities. There are other drawbacks, Dr. Schaffer
641	00:41:10.730	00:41:14.710	adds. We periodically close our emergency rooms to new patients
642	00:41:14.720	00:41:17.680	or we find ourselves at times having to discharge patients
643	00:41:17.690	00:41:19.840	somewhat earlier than we'd like to send them home just
644	00:41:19.850	00:41:22.010	because there aren't enough beds, not enough rooms in the
645	00:41:22.020	00:41:25.550	inn. And the same thing applies to our intensive care
646	00:41:25.560	00:41:27.970	units and coronary care unit beds in the community, where
647	00:41:27.980	00:41:31.200	we sometimes are shuffling patients around. While he praises the
648	00:41:31.210	00:41:35.240	community rating system for increasing access to healthcare, Schaffer is
649	00:41:35.250	00:41:39.250	critical of an approach he feels penalizes doctors. You cannot
650	00:41:39.260	00:41:41.790	place too much emphasis on the fact that the Rochester
651	00:41:41.800	00:41:45.420	system works because of the fact the physicians have accepted
652	00:41:45.430	00:41:48.950	a much lower reimbursement system here than elsewhere. Doctors are
653	00:41:48.960	00:41:52.590	also subjected to oversight from the insurance company. They must
654	00:41:52.600	00:41:56.890	often clear or justify medical or surgical decisions. Everyone else
655	00:41:56.900	00:42:00.440	in that system is concerned, primary concern is cost. The
656	00:42:00.450	00:42:03.890	physicians' primary concern is quality of care. The physicians find
657	00:42:03.900	00:42:08.460	themselves often placing themselves between the patients and the healthcare
658	00:42:08.470	00:42:11.860	system in order to protect the patients from the system.
659	00:42:11.870	00:42:14.900	However, patients of the Rochester healthcare system don't seem to
660	00:42:14.910	00:42:18.650	share that concern. A recent poll showed the vast majority
661	00:42:18.660	00:42:22.630	are satisfied. Dr. Robert Blendon of Harvard School of Public
662	00:42:22.640	00:42:26.430	Health who conducted the survey says overall, Rochester has a
663	00:42:26.440	00:42:29.940	balanced approach. I just don't see any evidence that Rochester
664	00:42:29.950	00:42:34.260	is a model of a declining culture of medical practice.
665	00:42:34.270	00:42:37.940	I think physicians who are paid less are angry, and
666	00:42:37.950	00:42:40.390	I can understand their frustration, but that's one of the
667	00:42:40.400	00:42:43.230	reasons why the average person in Rochester can afford their
668	00:42:43.240	00:42:46.860	health insurance. So if we have to trade off somewhat
669	00:42:46.870	00:42:50.560	less well paid physicians for people who can afford healthcare,
670	00:42:50.570	00:42:54.020	I always come down for healthcare. Along with doctors, Blendon
671	00:42:54.030	00:42:56.630	says patients will have to come to terms with limits
672	00:42:56.640	00:42:59.770	to their autonomy. It's a dilemma the Bowmans faced when
673	00:42:59.780	00:43:02.970	they attempted to move Jason to a rehabilitation facility in
674	00:43:02.980	00:43:07.200	Denver. The local hospital refused to make the referral needed
675	00:43:07.210	00:43:10.220	under their managed care policy. That was a plain old
676	00:43:10.230	00:43:14.440	statement that "this was as good as any other spinal
677	00:43:14.450	00:43:18.170	rehab facility in the world." And that's a quote. It's
678	00:43:18.180	00:43:21.460	not as good as any other. After producing research showing
679	00:43:21.470	00:43:25.670	Rochester lacked the specialized facility her son needed, Barbara Bowman
680	00:43:25.680	00:43:30.150	says the insurer relented. We can do that. Other people
681	00:43:30.160	00:43:34.370	that were maybe not quite as knowledgeable or a little
682	00:43:34.380	00:43:36.980	bit more meek than we were may have not been
683	00:43:36.990	00:43:39.440	effective in doing that. I don't know. Well, we're going
684	00:43:39.450	00:43:43.430	to face a choice. If you want an insurance plan
685	00:43:43.440	00:43:47.570	that allows you to go, for example, to every cancer
686	00:43:47.580	00:43:50.490	center in America that you choose, that plan will be
687	00:43:50.500	00:43:55.140	more expensive than one that says we've negotiated a special
688	00:43:55.150	00:43:58.510	rate at a center in our community. And I think
689	00:43:58.520	00:44:00.210	we're going to have to decide as a country if
690	00:44:00.220	00:44:03.920	we want to allow people to make those choices. The
691	00:44:03.930	00:44:06.970	Rochester plan was closely studied by members of the Clinton
692	00:44:06.980	00:44:09.520	task force, and parts of it will be reflected in
693	00:44:09.530	00:44:21.030	the plan Mr. Clinton presents to the Congress later tonight.
694	00:44:21.040	00:44:25.420	Finally tonight, one of our weekly Charlayne Hunter-Gault conversations. As
695	00:44:25.430	00:44:28.920	events unfolded in Moscow yesterday and today, the world was
696	00:44:28.930	00:44:32.850	scrambling to react to the situation. The breathtaking pace of
697	00:44:32.860	00:44:36.480	current events and how they frequently catch us unaware is
698	00:44:36.490	00:44:38.700	the theme of a new book The Roar of the
699	00:44:38.710	00:44:43.170	Crowd, How Television and People Power are Changing the World.
700	00:44:43.180	00:44:46.220	It's by former New York Daily News editor Mike O'Neill,
701	00:44:46.230	00:44:49.930	who recently sat down with Charlayne. Michael O'Neill, thank you
702	00:44:49.940	00:44:53.560	for joining us. Great to be here, Charlayne. You believe
703	00:44:53.570	00:44:57.600	that we're in the midst of a revolution not only
704	00:44:57.610	00:45:01.250	in America but in the entire world. Tell me a
705	00:45:01.260	00:45:04.390	little bit about that revolution. Well, I think that in
706	00:45:04.400	00:45:06.770	order to understand a lot of the dynamics of what's
707	00:45:06.780	00:45:09.080	now going on all over the world in terms of
708	00:45:09.090	00:45:13.910	ethnic strife and turmoil here and turmoil there, we have
709	00:45:13.920	00:45:15.930	to understand I think that one of the real catalysts
710	00:45:15.940	00:45:18.900	of all this is what I would call the mass
711	00:45:18.910	00:45:26.640	communications revolution, i.e., the enormous spread of television, computers, satellites,
712	00:45:26.650	00:45:31.410	et cetera, which is drawing the entire world together, much
713	00:45:31.420	00:45:37.600	more closely together than ever before in history. And it's--
714	00:45:37.610	00:45:40.830	it's a very profound kind of a revolution, just take
715	00:45:40.840	00:45:44.530	one aspect of it all. You now have most of--
716	00:45:44.540	00:45:48.680	certainly a large majority of the people of the world
717	00:45:48.690	00:45:53.530	seeing the world, seeing the world around them through television
718	00:45:53.540	00:45:56.350	for the first time in history, peasants who have never
719	00:45:56.360	00:46:01.250	even--don't even know how to read are able to
720	00:46:01.260	00:46:06.970	tune into the world. The monopoly of literacy, which has
721	00:46:06.980	00:46:12.010	existed really since the beginning of human history, that monopoly
722	00:46:12.020	00:46:15.790	has now been broken. What does it mean? After years
723	00:46:15.800	00:46:22.360	of exclusion really, ordinary people now are able to demand
724	00:46:22.370	00:46:26.590	their place in the sun. They're able to say that
725	00:46:26.600	00:46:28.750	they want the kind of life, the good life that
726	00:46:28.760	00:46:32.030	they see on the screen. That's what you, what's you
727	00:46:32.040	00:46:37.890	call "people power?" People power right, people that, for example,
728	00:46:37.900	00:46:42.430	in remote areas of China are now aware of the
729	00:46:42.440	00:46:46.150	enormous increase in economic wellbeing and the good life, for
730	00:46:46.160	00:46:50.480	example, being led by many of their fellow Chinese say
731	00:46:50.490	00:46:56.940	in Eastern provinces, in Fujian and Guan Dong. And they
732	00:46:56.950	00:47:02.970	then register their feelings locally, and those are felt and
733	00:47:02.980	00:47:06.810	even though they are not out necessarily demonstrating today or
734	00:47:06.820	00:47:10.360	tomorrow or the next day, although there is, as we
735	00:47:10.370	00:47:12.570	see all over the world, a great deal of activism.
736	00:47:12.580	00:47:15.940	We see people migrating as a result of what they
737	00:47:15.950	00:47:21.030	see on television. We see people demonstrating. The students in
738	00:47:21.040	00:47:28.110	Tiananmen Square had seen demonstrations in South Korea that influenced
739	00:47:28.120	00:47:33.890	their desire to demonstrate in Tiananmen Square, an amazing thing.
740	00:47:33.900	00:47:35.690	One of the things you write in your book is
741	00:47:35.700	00:47:40.000	that society shaped by the mass media are coming to
742	00:47:40.010	00:47:45.770	dominate the world. Tell me a little about that. Well,
743	00:47:45.780	00:47:48.850	let's take, for example, this fad that we now have
744	00:47:48.860	00:47:50.760	going around the world. We have the idea in the
745	00:47:50.770	00:47:54.630	United States that somehow or other democracy has triumphed as
746	00:47:54.640	00:47:59.770	a result of the collapse of Communism. And it's true
747	00:47:59.780	00:48:04.090	that Communism has collapsed, but we don't--I don't think
748	00:48:04.100	00:48:08.070	we know whether democracy is going to triumph. One of
749	00:48:08.080	00:48:12.370	the aspects of, and one of the most popular aspects
750	00:48:12.380	00:48:19.510	of the so-called western, liberal western approach to government, et
751	00:48:19.520	00:48:30.210	cetera, is a, a consumerism, i.e., a mass marketing of
752	00:48:30.220	00:48:34.510	goods, a mass marketing of services, et cetera, and that
753	00:48:34.520	00:48:38.920	is now being spread around the world as part of
754	00:48:38.930	00:48:43.660	the democratic "western model" of the way a global, an
755	00:48:43.670	00:48:47.830	interdependent global economy is now going to operate. What does
756	00:48:47.840	00:48:52.740	that do? In China now, you have TV commercials which
757	00:48:52.750	00:48:57.160	people are being urged to buy this, that or other
758	00:48:57.170	00:49:03.400	individual item, consumer goods, toothpaste, what have you. Well, that
759	00:49:03.410	00:49:09.840	is the phenomenal--that's a real phenomenon because it is
760	00:49:09.850	00:49:18.040	a direct approach to an individual consumer in China and
761	00:49:18.050	00:49:20.860	asking that consumer to make a decision on the basis
762	00:49:20.870	00:49:26.010	of what he or she saw on television, that is
763	00:49:26.020	00:49:31.800	pushing the idea of individualism that is quite antithetical to
764	00:49:31.810	00:49:40.350	the kind of family-oriented, ancestor, ancestor-oriented, or group-oriented kind of
765	00:49:40.360	00:49:43.690	society that has existed for centuries in China. Now nothing's
766	00:49:43.700	00:49:51.090	going to happen today or tomorrow, but what this whole
767	00:49:51.100	00:49:55.740	force is doing, all this mass communication of the mass
768	00:49:55.750	00:50:01.410	marketing idea, is doing, it's breaking down these kinds of
769	00:50:01.420	00:50:08.960	social patterns, and at the same time it's, it's--it
770	00:50:08.970	00:50:15.080	tends to promote individualism versus collectivism, which is the hallmark
771	00:50:15.090	00:50:21.500	of the totalitarian systems. And it promotes pluralism as against
772	00:50:21.510	00:50:26.330	mass, the kind of mass governance that we saw in
773	00:50:26.340	00:50:31.610	the case of Nazism. But you also say that while
774	00:50:31.620	00:50:36.910	people power is becoming nearly universal, it is, because of
775	00:50:36.920	00:50:41.820	the nature of the medium, the potential for having power
776	00:50:41.830	00:50:48.150	without knowledge is great. Right. Now explain that. Well, I
777	00:50:48.160	00:50:50.550	guess what I'm talking about there is the fact that
778	00:50:50.560	00:50:55.470	if you have a governing, a system of government in
779	00:50:55.480	00:51:00.850	which the decisions are being driven by instant emotional reactions
780	00:51:00.860	00:51:04.130	to an event, for example, why did the United States
781	00:51:04.140	00:51:07.000	become involved in Somalia? It became involved because of the
782	00:51:07.010	00:51:12.290	emotional reaction of the American people. Why did President Mitterrand
783	00:51:12.300	00:51:15.840	fly to Sarajevo? Because he was under pressure to do
784	00:51:15.850	00:51:19.830	something. Of course, he ultimately never, never, ultimately didn't do
785	00:51:19.840	00:51:24.000	very much. But that's a good thing, isn't it? Yeah.
786	00:51:24.010	00:51:25.850	The part of it that's good, of course, is that
787	00:51:25.860	00:51:31.030	it does force the governing, ruling elite, if you will,
788	00:51:31.040	00:51:34.700	to be conscious of and to respond and be sensitive
789	00:51:34.710	00:51:38.350	to public opinion. On the other hand, if that public
790	00:51:38.360	00:51:45.160	opinion demands immediate action in any given instance, it eliminates
791	00:51:45.170	00:51:51.020	the kind of deliberative process, the period of time when
792	00:51:51.030	00:51:55.050	you would take normally to study a problem and deliberate
793	00:51:55.060	00:51:58.550	the pros and cons, consider all the options, and ultimately
794	00:51:58.560	00:52:04.210	make a decision based on a very reasoned kind of
795	00:52:04.220	00:52:10.170	discourse, and deliberative process. That's quite different from immediately reacting
796	00:52:10.180	00:52:14.170	to some emotional explosion. The other part of all this
797	00:52:14.180	00:52:20.550	is it tends to, to focus the leadership of the
798	00:52:20.560	00:52:25.840	government, say the White House, on a daily rush of
799	00:52:25.850	00:52:31.760	crises--the floods out in the Middle West one day,
800	00:52:31.770	00:52:36.990	the riots in South Central Los Angeles another day. And
801	00:52:37.000	00:52:43.050	longer range and deeper problems that have no telegenicity, that
802	00:52:43.060	00:52:47.670	have no--cannot be easily translated into images--those tend
803	00:52:47.680	00:52:51.070	to fall into the back burner, don't get any attention
804	00:52:51.080	00:52:53.240	at all. And yet, in the long run, they may
805	00:52:53.250	00:52:57.190	be much more, much more important to deal with. You
806	00:52:57.200	00:53:01.980	also believe that journalists are complicit in this, right? Well,
807	00:53:01.990	00:53:08.510	yeah, right. You mean, me? Co-conspirators, present company excepted of
808	00:53:08.520	00:53:11.020	course. Of course. One of the things you say is
809	00:53:11.030	00:53:14.920	that journalists arrive late at the front lines of history.
810	00:53:14.930	00:53:18.770	Right, right. What's the answer to this? I mean, because
811	00:53:18.780	00:53:23.300	you write about a society dominated by mass media that
812	00:53:23.310	00:53:30.080	is a--appealing to the lowest common denominator of culture.
813	00:53:30.090	00:53:33.350	You talked about the consumerism now, the lowest common denominator
814	00:53:33.360	00:53:39.190	of politics. What's the answer? Well--Is the genie out
815	00:53:39.200	00:53:43.110	of the bottle? I think it is. I think technology
816	00:53:43.120	00:53:48.570	is really driving society. It is actually driving change, and
817	00:53:48.580	00:53:54.090	the velocity, and the volume of change are simply enormous,
818	00:53:54.100	00:53:59.800	and it's driving change faster than institutions, including journalism, are
819	00:53:59.810	00:54:06.890	able to, to adapt to that change. And I--the
820	00:54:06.900	00:54:09.780	great fear I have, instead of all this euphoria about
821	00:54:09.790	00:54:12.550	the collapse of Communism and the heyday of a new
822	00:54:12.560	00:54:20.080	world order, as George Bush put it, is that, that
823	00:54:20.090	00:54:24.790	we may have the--we may--the stresses of social
824	00:54:24.800	00:54:29.820	and political stresses may be building up so rapidly, so
825	00:54:29.830	00:54:34.390	much faster than the institutions are adapting to, to cope
826	00:54:34.400	00:54:37.980	with 'em, you can have the same kind of social
827	00:54:37.990	00:54:40.540	breakdown that you had after World War I, which would
828	00:54:40.550	00:54:43.910	be an absolute catastrophe. Do I have the solution to
829	00:54:43.920	00:54:46.300	this? If there is any kind of solution at all,
830	00:54:46.310	00:54:48.820	I think we have to put an emphasis on prevention
831	00:54:48.830	00:54:52.350	instead of reaction. Journalism now is designed to react. It's
832	00:54:52.360	00:54:56.760	designed to report what has already happened. But it's always
833	00:54:56.770	00:54:59.540	been the case. Yes, exactly. So what's different, and what's
834	00:54:59.550	00:55:03.470	new? And why would someone watching this not say, well,
835	00:55:03.480	00:55:06.470	these are the musings of a print man who's probably
836	00:55:06.480	00:55:12.800	always had an electronic media bias? Right. Exactly. Well, No.
837	00:55:12.810	00:55:14.720	1, I think that the print media have the same
838	00:55:14.730	00:55:17.430	responsibility to try to move ahead of the curb, to
839	00:55:17.440	00:55:19.910	get ahead of the curb, rather than falling in behind
840	00:55:19.920	00:55:23.270	the curb. Now, as I say in the book, I
841	00:55:23.280	00:55:25.820	don't know whether this could be achieved or not. I'm
842	00:55:25.830	00:55:30.080	just saying that an ideal world would be one in
843	00:55:30.090	00:55:35.210	which journalism, politics, and diplomacy would try to catch social
844	00:55:35.220	00:55:38.000	change at a much earlier stage. If we don't do
845	00:55:38.010	00:55:45.780	that, all sorts of tremendous problems are coming down, coming
846	00:55:45.790	00:55:50.690	down the pike at us, and the psychology that is
847	00:55:50.700	00:55:55.940	integral to what, the kind of mass consumerism that we're
848	00:55:55.950	00:56:00.590	talking about, the so-called mass market economy that we're pushing
849	00:56:00.600	00:56:05.150	around the world, that psychology is to think about today
850	00:56:05.160	00:56:09.200	and not tomorrow. And I worry. That's a very serious
851	00:56:09.210	00:56:12.460	concern of mine. Well, Michael O'Neill, I hate to end
852	00:56:12.470	00:56:15.660	on that note, but we will. Thank you for joining
853	00:56:15.670	00:56:28.550	us. Thank you. Again, the main stories of this Wednesday,
854	00:56:28.560	00:56:31.490	at least 40 people were killed when an Amtrak passenger
855	00:56:31.500	00:56:35.510	train derailed and plunged into a bayou near Mobile, Alabama.
856	00:56:35.520	00:56:39.430	Officials said 13 people are still missing. Boris Yeltsin appeared
857	00:56:39.440	00:56:41.660	to gain the upper hand in this political battle with
858	00:56:41.670	00:56:45.380	hardliners for control of Russia, and President Clinton prepared to
859	00:56:45.390	00:56:48.680	unveil details of his long-awaited healthcare reform plan in his
860	00:56:48.690	00:56:52.320	speech to the Congress. Good night, Margaret. Good night, Roger.
861	00:56:52.330	00:56:54.900	That's the NewsHour for tonight. We will have full coverage
862	00:56:54.910	00:56:57.880	of the President's healthcare speech to Congress later tonight on
863	00:56:57.890	00:57:01.600	most of these PBS stations, and we'll be back tomorrow
864	00:57:01.610	00:57:04.620	with an in-depth look at the Clinton plan. I'm Margaret
865	00:57:04.630	01:03:12.177	Warner. Thank you, and good night.
