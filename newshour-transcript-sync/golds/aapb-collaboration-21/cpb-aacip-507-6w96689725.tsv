1	00:02:43.920	00:02:47.690	Good evening. Anyone with the mildest interest in the Presidential
2	00:02:47.700	00:02:50.710	election might be forgiven for thinking that abortion was the
3	00:02:50.720	00:02:54.050	number one issue dividing Ford and Carter. For the past
4	00:02:54.060	00:02:56.750	week or ten days, abortion has often appeared to dominate
5	00:02:56.760	00:02:59.840	the news, with both candidates appearing before a panel of
6	00:02:59.850	00:03:03.330	Roman Catholic bishops, with the Ford camp talking about the
7	00:03:03.340	00:03:08.780	crucial Catholic vote, and with anti-abortion demonstrators dogging Carter's trail.
8	00:03:08.790	00:03:11.420	Yesterday the dispute spread to Congress, with an argument over
9	00:03:11.430	00:03:14.500	whether to cut off federal funding of abortions for poor
10	00:03:14.510	00:03:18.020	women. The National Organization for Women has claimed that the
11	00:03:18.030	00:03:21.310	candidates are being intimidated by the bishops and are ignoring
12	00:03:21.320	00:03:23.910	the views of what they call "a majority of American
13	00:03:23.920	00:03:28.180	women." And a national organization of priests expressed deep concern
14	00:03:28.190	00:03:30.720	that the bishops were stressing abortion to the neglect of
15	00:03:30.730	00:03:34.080	other issues. So, while the polls may show that abortion
16	00:03:34.090	00:03:37.720	is one of the least urgent concerns of most voters,
17	00:03:37.730	00:03:41.200	the issue has firmly planted itself in the campaign. Tonight:
18	00:03:41.210	00:03:44.580	Where does the abortion issue really belong in this election?
19	00:03:44.590	00:03:48.600	First, where the candidates actually stand. Here's what Mr. Ford
20	00:03:48.610	00:03:51.300	told a news conference after his meeting with the bishops
21	00:03:51.310	00:03:55.370	on Friday: The Democratic platform and the Republican platform on
22	00:03:55.380	00:03:59.470	the issue of abortion are quite different. I subscribe to
23	00:03:59.480	00:04:04.750	the Republican platform and Governor Carter subscribes to the Democratic
24	00:04:04.760	00:04:09.830	platform. His position and mine are not identical; my position
25	00:04:09.840	00:04:13.870	is that of the Republican platform, and I'll stick with
26	00:04:13.880	00:04:19.710	it. I have had the position for some time that
27	00:04:19.720	00:04:23.020	there should be a Constitutional amendment that would permit the
28	00:04:23.030	00:04:27.540	individual states to make the decision based on a vote
29	00:04:27.550	00:04:31.440	of the people of each of the states. The bishops
30	00:04:31.450	00:04:34.720	said they were encouraged, but not totally satisfied by the
31	00:04:34.730	00:04:38.150	President's stand. On the other hand, they had been disappointed
32	00:04:38.160	00:04:41.550	in Jimmy Carter's statement ten days before that while he
33	00:04:41.560	00:04:45.600	personally opposes abortion he does not support a Constitutional amendment
34	00:04:45.610	00:04:50.400	on the subject. Anti-abortion, or pro-life people have shown themselves
35	00:04:50.410	00:04:53.030	to be more than disappointed in Mr. Carter. He's been
36	00:04:53.040	00:04:55.470	on the receiving end of a number of their demonstrations
37	00:04:55.480	00:05:02.260	recently; one example, a gathering in Scranton, Pennsylvania last week:
38	00:05:02.270	00:05:17.290	Life! Life! Life! It's rather ironic that abortion should turn
39	00:05:17.300	00:05:20.260	out to be such a thorny issue for Jimmy Carter,
40	00:05:20.270	00:05:22.810	because according to most people he scored his first victory
41	00:05:22.820	00:05:25.940	in the Iowa caucuses way back in January because of
42	00:05:25.950	00:05:29.620	pro-life support. But afterward he was accused of having misled
43	00:05:29.630	00:05:32.480	the people about where he stood. Some thought that because
44	00:05:32.490	00:05:35.590	he said he backed a national statute on abortion Carter
45	00:05:35.600	00:05:38.820	supported a Constitutional amendment on the issue. Carter said he
46	00:05:38.830	00:05:42.000	didn't and he doesn't, even though he is personally against
47	00:05:42.010	00:05:45.640	abortion. The impact of the abortion question appeared to fade
48	00:05:45.650	00:05:48.650	after the early primaries; the only major candidate who made
49	00:05:48.660	00:05:51.090	a profit on the issue was Ronald Reagan, who won
50	00:05:51.100	00:05:53.900	the backing of many anti-abortion groups for his support of
51	00:05:53.910	00:05:58.310	a Constitutional amendment banning abortions. The issue came up again
52	00:05:58.320	00:06:02.330	during the party's nominating conventions and platform hearings. The Democrats
53	00:06:02.340	00:06:05.320	stated in their platform that while they recognized the religious
54	00:06:05.330	00:06:07.860	and ethical nature of the question, they believed it was
55	00:06:07.870	00:06:11.100	undesirable to attempt to amend the Constitution to overturn the
56	00:06:11.110	00:06:14.540	Supreme Court's decision on the matter. The stand drew fire
57	00:06:14.550	00:06:17.440	from within the party, denounced during a nominating speech for
58	00:06:17.450	00:06:20.380	Ellen McCormick, the Long Island housewife who had run for
59	00:06:20.390	00:06:25.400	President as a pro-life candidate: I have supported the human
60	00:06:25.410	00:06:31.300	and civil rights movement all of my adult life. I
61	00:06:31.310	00:06:38.370	am deeply concerned that in this age of technology we
62	00:06:38.380	00:06:44.190	are not concerned with the protection of those who cannot
63	00:06:44.200	00:06:51.110	protect themselves: the unborn child...At their convention, the Republicans
64	00:06:51.120	00:06:55.470	nominated Gerald Ford but gave him an abortion platform plank
65	00:06:55.480	00:06:58.220	that appeared to have been designed by Ronald Reagan. It
66	00:06:58.230	00:07:01.180	called for the continuance of the public dialogue on abortion
67	00:07:01.190	00:07:03.580	and supported the efforts of those seeking the enactment of
68	00:07:03.590	00:07:09.580	a Constitutional amendment to "restore life for unborn children." The
69	00:07:09.590	00:07:13.870	Reverend James Ratigan is President of the National Federation of
70	00:07:13.880	00:07:18.110	Priests` Councils. Father Ratigan, yesterday your organization, as I said
71	00:07:18.120	00:07:22.500	at the beginning of the program, expressed some concern over
72	00:07:22.510	00:07:27.220	the stress that the bishops were placing on abortion. Why
73	00:07:27.230	00:07:29.510	did you do that? Is abortion not a number one
74	00:07:29.520	00:07:32.590	issue to you? It is a number one issue to
75	00:07:32.600	00:07:36.680	us and our board. The context in which we wrote
76	00:07:36.690	00:07:40.400	the letter to Cardinal Cook was that members from his
77	00:07:40.410	00:07:43.850	committee came out to speak to our executive board-28
78	00:07:43.860	00:07:47.960	priests from across the country--and we met to try
79	00:07:47.970	00:07:52.460	talk to them: how could we join together to ensure
80	00:07:52.470	00:07:55.400	that an amendment would be passed? In the course of
81	00:07:55.410	00:07:59.230	that, though, we did mention in the letter that one
82	00:07:59.240	00:08:02.210	of the overriding concerns that many of the members expressed
83	00:08:02.220	00:08:07.360	at the board meeting was that it seemed to be
84	00:08:07.370	00:08:09.750	an impression that they were getting that the bishops were
85	00:08:09.760	00:08:13.380	stressing this one issue. And back in February in their
86	00:08:13.390	00:08:16.960	pamphlet on the political responsibility in an election year they
87	00:08:16.970	00:08:19.800	called for us to look at all the candidates on
88	00:08:19.810	00:08:23.250	a very broad base of issues, and look for those
89	00:08:23.260	00:08:27.370	issues which would present a more wide range. And we
90	00:08:27.380	00:08:30.220	felt the bishops were falling into the trap themselves of
91	00:08:30.230	00:08:33.540	judging candidates on a single issue. Do you agree with
92	00:08:33.550	00:08:37.260	those who think that this antiabortion activity could hurt the
93	00:08:37.270	00:08:42.360	Church, cause a backlash and alienate members? It could, but
94	00:08:42.370	00:08:43.710	I don't think that would be a reason for us
95	00:08:43.720	00:08:48.610	not to continue our own fight to change the Constitution.
96	00:08:48.620	00:08:50.400	But I think that in the context of doing so
97	00:08:50.410	00:08:52.970	we have to do so in a way that will
98	00:08:52.980	00:08:55.760	eliminate that possibility as much as possible--but we do
99	00:08:55.770	00:08:59.450	have to speak out. Yours is a grassroots organization, so
100	00:08:59.460	00:09:03.630	to speak; you have, I gather, 117 councils in approximately
101	00:09:03.640	00:09:06.450	45 states--how do you assess the reaction to the
102	00:09:06.460	00:09:09.290	bishops` efforts at that level, at the grassroots level, in
103	00:09:09.300	00:09:12.830	the Church? Well, as the Board reported at the meeting,
104	00:09:12.840	00:09:14.950	there seems to be a certain hesitancy on the part
105	00:09:14.960	00:09:19.900	of many priests to get into the issue right now.
106	00:09:19.910	00:09:24.060	And I think that's partly because they sense that many
107	00:09:24.070	00:09:26.420	of the forces who are right now pushing for a
108	00:09:26.430	00:09:30.620	Constitutional amendment are not the people who are a broad-based,
109	00:09:30.630	00:09:33.520	pro-life group; and that they find a lot of difficulty
110	00:09:33.530	00:09:36.450	with that. Is that because the rank and file in
111	00:09:36.460	00:09:39.100	the Catholic Church is less inclined than it might have
112	00:09:39.110	00:09:41.840	been in the past to take guidance on such issues
113	00:09:41.850	00:09:45.620	from the hierarchy in the Church? I think they are
114	00:09:45.630	00:09:50.330	less inclined. I think that's one of the problems with
115	00:09:50.340	00:09:53.510	the program as it's presently presented.--that we'd like to
116	00:09:53.520	00:09:57.270	see a stronger emphasis on even speaking to our own
117	00:09:57.280	00:10:00.800	people, in an educational manner, or a way of trying
118	00:10:00.810	00:10:04.100	to bring their consciences into what we believe should be
119	00:10:04.110	00:10:07.420	a correct stance before we go before a general public
120	00:10:07.430	00:10:12.080	and call for a Constitutional amendment. Thank you. Jim? Robin,
121	00:10:12.090	00:10:15.230	Monsignor James McHugh is Director of the Pastoral Plan for
122	00:10:15.240	00:10:18.290	Pro-Life Activities for the Bishops` Conference and as such is
123	00:10:18.300	00:10:21.950	one of the key leaders in the anti-abortion movement. Monsignor,
124	00:10:21.960	00:10:24.150	you've heard what Father Ratigan has had to say; do
125	00:10:24.160	00:10:27.170	you agree with his criticism of the bishops` stand, that
126	00:10:27.180	00:10:30.670	they may have lost sight of their own instructions for
127	00:10:30.680	00:10:33.670	a broad-based approach in this election? No, I don't agree
128	00:10:33.680	00:10:37.890	with Father Ratigan. The bishops have consistently said that their
129	00:10:37.900	00:10:41.820	concern about abortion, though fundamental, is the broad basis on
130	00:10:41.830	00:10:47.080	which they then voice their concerns about those other problems
131	00:10:47.090	00:10:50.010	in our society, or dangers in our society, which would
132	00:10:50.020	00:10:53.460	in some way or other endanger other rights--the right
133	00:10:53.470	00:10:56.400	to eat, the right to jobs, the right to housing.
134	00:10:56.410	00:10:59.910	In other words, the bishops see the abortion issue in
135	00:10:59.920	00:11:02.680	a broad context of human rights which the Church should
136	00:11:02.690	00:11:05.780	speak out in favor of. Why has the Church not
137	00:11:05.790	00:11:08.610	been heard on the other issues and only on abortion?
138	00:11:08.620	00:11:13.460	Because the abortion issue has been interjected into this Presidential
139	00:11:13.470	00:11:18.880	campaign, and as a result has received unprecedented visibility. The
140	00:11:18.890	00:11:21.050	bishops didn't give it that, of course-the press gave
141	00:11:21.060	00:11:23.460	it that, the media gave it that--and I think
142	00:11:23.470	00:11:25.880	that the reason that it has achieved that kind of
143	00:11:25.890	00:11:28.640	visibility is that it is something that people understand readily.
144	00:11:28.650	00:11:31.180	It's harder for people to understand how the two candidates
145	00:11:31.190	00:11:34.650	for the Presidency are going to fine-tune the economy; but
146	00:11:34.660	00:11:37.130	the abortion issue is close to them. Let's pursue that
147	00:11:37.140	00:11:41.200	a minute, Monsignor. Has a group of bishops called on
148	00:11:41.210	00:11:43.940	President Ford and Jimmy Carter and asked them what they're
149	00:11:43.950	00:11:45.710	going to do about the poor people, what they're going
150	00:11:45.720	00:11:47.860	to do about inflation, what they're going to do about
151	00:11:47.870	00:11:51.140	foreign aid? It was abortion that the bishops went to
152	00:11:51.150	00:11:53.690	see the two candidates about, was it not? No, not
153	00:11:53.700	00:11:58.170	quite. The discussion with President Ford ranged over five or
154	00:11:58.180	00:12:03.620	six different issues; the abortion issue got primary concern, but
155	00:12:03.630	00:12:06.130	the other issues were treated equally and fairly. They did
156	00:12:06.140	00:12:09.290	speak about employment, they did speak about human rights in
157	00:12:09.300	00:12:12.380	various countries throughout the world and the relevance of our
158	00:12:12.390	00:12:15.710	foreign policy to the protection of human rights. So we
159	00:12:15.720	00:12:17.330	did get a chance to kind of spread the base
160	00:12:17.340	00:12:21.920	a little bit there; however, with Governor Carter the discussion
161	00:12:21.930	00:12:23.960	stayed pretty much on the abortion issue because that was
162	00:12:23.970	00:12:26.720	what the Governor wanted to speak about, it was something
163	00:12:26.730	00:12:28.580	that he wanted to try to understand the bishops better
164	00:12:28.590	00:12:30.490	on, and it was something that they wanted to try
165	00:12:30.500	00:12:33.700	to be fair and understanding to him about. Have you
166	00:12:33.710	00:12:36.900	picked up any of the hesitancy that Father Ratigan talked
167	00:12:36.910	00:12:39.120	about on the part of the parish priest to really
168	00:12:39.130	00:12:41.880	get out front on this issue? No, I don't think
169	00:12:41.890	00:12:44.820	we've picked up that kind of hesitancy. Now, remember, we're
170	00:12:44.830	00:12:48.370	talking about 50,000 priests around the country and it's pretty
171	00:12:48.380	00:12:51.020	difficult to tell where they all are at any time
172	00:12:51.030	00:12:53.760	in any one issue; but from our perspective we have
173	00:12:53.770	00:12:56.860	programs that are directed towards the priests, and we find
174	00:12:56.870	00:13:00.460	them highly cooperative on a wide range of programs. Naturally,
175	00:13:00.470	00:13:03.730	some are going to prioritize--some will be more concerned...
176	00:13:03.740	00:13:06.690	Going to do what, sir? Some will prioritize. Those working
177	00:13:06.700	00:13:07.930	in the inner city, of course, are going to be
178	00:13:07.940	00:13:10.550	more concerned about inner-city problems than they would be about
179	00:13:10.560	00:13:14.320	a more widespread problem such as abortion that doesn't affect
180	00:13:14.330	00:13:17.820	them day-to-day. But we find cooperation from the priests; and
181	00:13:17.830	00:13:21.450	as a matter of fact, the bishops` program for respect
182	00:13:21.460	00:13:24.560	for human life, which will be kicked off on October
183	00:13:24.570	00:13:28.840	the 3rd, is presently enjoying tremendous support from the priests
184	00:13:28.850	00:13:32.940	throughout the country. Then you don't feel that this is
185	00:13:32.950	00:13:36.530	hurting the Church, this effort on abortion, and you don't
186	00:13:36.540	00:13:38.660	feel the Catholic Church is going to be turned into
187	00:13:38.670	00:13:41.910	a one-issue institution, as has been suggested? I can assure
188	00:13:41.920	00:13:43.790	you, it's not going to be turned into a one-issue
189	00:13:43.800	00:13:48.090	institution. As a matter of fact, the visibility given the
190	00:13:48.100	00:13:52.390	abortion issue has prodded us to look more closely at
191	00:13:52.400	00:13:55.240	all of the other issues and try to find consistency
192	00:13:55.250	00:13:57.180	between our concerns for the right to life of the
193	00:13:57.190	00:13:59.580	unborn and the right to life and the quality of
194	00:13:59.590	00:14:02.400	life of those already born. I doubt that it will
195	00:14:02.410	00:14:05.700	harm the Church's so-called image in this society because I
196	00:14:05.710	00:14:07.980	think people are fair-minded; they know that the Church has
197	00:14:07.990	00:14:10.710	a moral concern here, and they expect churches to have
198	00:14:10.720	00:14:15.270	moral concerns. Monsignor, thank you. Betsey Stengel is Associate Director
199	00:14:15.280	00:14:19.320	of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights, a national pro-abortion
200	00:14:19.330	00:14:22.510	group. Ms. Stengel, is your group doing anything to offset
201	00:14:22.520	00:14:26.090	the pro-life activities in this campaign, and if so, what?
202	00:14:26.100	00:14:28.140	We certainly are; we've been working for the last six
203	00:14:28.150	00:14:34.260	months at all levels of political activity. Most markedly, I
204	00:14:34.270	00:14:38.410	think, recently, we worked very closely to represent the Protestant-Jewish
205	00:14:38.420	00:14:42.250	communities` feeling in support of abortion rights for the Democratic
206	00:14:42.260	00:14:47.280	platform, and worked very closely with Mr. Carter's staff in
207	00:14:47.290	00:14:54.000	achieving that platform. We are now engaged in expressing very
208	00:14:54.010	00:14:59.660	strongly the feeling that the representation of abortion rights is
209	00:14:59.670	00:15:03.090	not there at the national political level. Neither candidate now
210	00:15:03.100	00:15:06.430	has a position which completely pleases us. Where are you
211	00:15:06.440	00:15:11.190	expressing it? We're not hearing it anywhere. I think there
212	00:15:11.200	00:15:14.250	are two aspects to that question. One is that our
213	00:15:14.260	00:15:18.310	people are actively writing letters to the candidates--I just
214	00:15:18.320	00:15:20.920	talked this morning to some people on Carter's staff, and
215	00:15:20.930	00:15:24.260	they are being swamped with protest letters at the moment.
216	00:15:24.270	00:15:27.360	The Protestant and Jewish community has requested a meeting with
217	00:15:27.370	00:15:32.040	both candidates, both Mr. Ford and Governor Carter, and we
218	00:15:32.050	00:15:34.250	are waiting now for...Similar to what the bishops did?
219	00:15:34.260	00:15:37.390	Right. We feel it's very important to...Has this been
220	00:15:37.400	00:15:41.470	formally done? Absolutely, and we have talked to both candidates`
221	00:15:41.480	00:15:43.500	headquarters and we are in the process of awaiting a
222	00:15:43.510	00:15:47.260	response; and in fact, today when we talked to Carter
223	00:15:47.270	00:15:50.110	headquarters again they informed us that they will be back
224	00:15:50.120	00:15:53.800	in touch very soon. We are also, next week, to
225	00:15:53.810	00:15:57.690	be hearing more on the public media platform from religious
226	00:15:57.700	00:16:01.460	leaders all over the country about the fact that the
227	00:16:01.470	00:16:03.810	Protestant and Jewish community are not being represented on this
228	00:16:03.820	00:16:07.170	issue. Alright, you said that neither one of these candidates`
229	00:16:07.180	00:16:10.690	positions particularly please you because both of them have said
230	00:16:10.700	00:16:13.790	they are opposed to abortion--as you would say, abortion
231	00:16:13.800	00:16:15.440	by choice--is that correct?
232	00:16:15.450	00:16:18.060	Right. I think there's definitely, as far as we are
233	00:16:18.070	00:16:22.310	concerned, is a difference between our support for Mr. Ford's
234	00:16:22.320	00:16:27.010	position and our support for Governor Carter's position. We totally
235	00:16:27.020	00:16:30.640	oppose a Constitutional amendment, and therefore we are totally opposed
236	00:16:30.650	00:16:34.620	to the Ford position. And we have no quarrel with
237	00:16:34.630	00:16:37.770	Mr. Carter's statement that he is personally opposed to abortion;
238	00:16:37.780	00:16:41.380	we certainly have room in our position for that. However,
239	00:16:41.390	00:16:46.410	we do oppose his position on federal funding of abortion,
240	00:16:46.420	00:16:49.070	and I believe that he has left himself open in
241	00:16:49.080	00:16:52.930	certain cases for allowing the feeling that he would support
242	00:16:52.940	00:16:55.600	a Constitutional amendment if it meant certain requirements means and
243	00:16:55.610	00:16:58.020	we are saying that we would not support any such
244	00:16:58.030	00:17:02.050	law. You have mentioned two or three times now the
245	00:17:02.060	00:17:05.090	Protestant-Jewish community, of course, Father
246	00:17:05.100	00:17:09.710	McHugh and Father Ratigan represent the Catholic community. Are we
247	00:17:09.720	00:17:11.890	on the verge of having a religious war over the
248	00:17:11.900	00:17:15.500	issue of abortion? I sincerely doubt it, and even more,
249	00:17:15.510	00:17:19.270	I sincerely hope not. I think, thank God, we have
250	00:17:19.280	00:17:21.620	reached the point in this country where we will not
251	00:17:21.630	00:17:25.490	have religious wars any more, war. I didn't mean war
252	00:17:25.500	00:17:29.640	literally, I meant a political...I know. I would be
253	00:17:29.650	00:17:31.940	willing to talk more in terms of a political war,
254	00:17:31.950	00:17:34.490	and I fear it not at all from the religious
255	00:17:34.500	00:17:38.670	community itself. What I really fear is, for instance, the
256	00:17:38.680	00:17:43.320	reports that we have had that Ford's staff member said:
257	00:17:43.330	00:17:46.280	they are going to play on the Catholic vote, and
258	00:17:46.290	00:17:50.120	more, they are going to play on the dichotomy between
259	00:17:50.130	00:17:52.830	the--the "cultural dichotomy," I think the word was--between
260	00:17:52.840	00:17:56.060	the Catholic and Baptists. And we should have passed that
261	00:17:56.070	00:18:00.200	period in our history and move on to getting along.
262	00:18:00.210	00:18:03.900	I think the religious community has reached the point where
263	00:18:03.910	00:18:07.830	at least we are trying to agree to disagree, and
264	00:18:07.840	00:18:10.740	the politics do not help the situation at the moment
265	00:18:10.750	00:18:13.190	and I hope the candidates do not try to divide
266	00:18:13.200	00:18:18.190	the religious community because of that. Thank you. Robin? Jeffrey
267	00:18:18.200	00:18:21.600	Pressman is a political science professor at M.I.T., and he's
268	00:18:21.610	00:18:26.220	working on a study of the 1976 Presidential election. Mr. Pressman,
269	00:18:26.230	00:18:28.500	you were with us last February when we discussed this
270	00:18:28.510	00:18:30.610	issue; you told us then you thought the abortion issue
271	00:18:30.620	00:18:33.570	was going to fade away. What happened? I guess, Mr.
272	00:18:33.580	00:18:37.200	MacNeil, that's one of the disadvantages of being two times
273	00:18:37.210	00:18:39.020	on the same program, as you have to live with
274	00:18:39.030	00:18:42.320	your own predictions. I think in the short run, as
275	00:18:42.330	00:18:46.110	was pointed out earlier, the issue did fade away after
276	00:18:46.120	00:18:50.360	the Iowa caucuses; and that's, I think, because the abortion
277	00:18:50.370	00:18:54.220	issue was linked to the candidacy of Ellen McCormick, who
278	00:18:54.230	00:18:57.310	was not an extremely potent candidate and ended up getting
279	00:18:57.320	00:19:01.480	a total of about 1.5% of the total vote cast.
280	00:19:01.490	00:19:05.350	Now, however, the abortion issue is being stressed by a
281	00:19:05.360	00:19:08.330	much more important candidate, President Ford, and I think that
282	00:19:08.340	00:19:10.890	that's one reason why it has surfaced again as an
283	00:19:10.900	00:19:14.270	issue. The difference in the two party platforms and the
284	00:19:14.280	00:19:19.170	work of making up those platforms, I think, also ensured
285	00:19:19.180	00:19:23.480	that it would become an issue; the bishops have, in
286	00:19:23.490	00:19:26.480	their public statements and apparently in the private meetings of
287	00:19:26.490	00:19:29.960	candidates, also been stressing the issue; and also the fact
288	00:19:29.970	00:19:32.800	that the election seems to be turning on some very
289	00:19:32.810	00:19:37.930	closely fought northern industrial states with large Catholic populations--all
290	00:19:37.940	00:19:41.750	of those things ensure, I think, that the issue will
291	00:19:41.760	00:19:47.980	receive visibility. Good. President Ford's campaign manager, James Baker, told
292	00:19:47.990	00:19:51.090	reporters this today: "It is a campaign issue whether we
293	00:19:51.100	00:19:52.930	like it or not; we are pleased it is an
294	00:19:52.940	00:19:56.250	issue because the bishops came out on our side." And
295	00:19:56.260	00:19:58.830	he added in response to questions that the issue could
296	00:19:58.840	00:20:02.110	bring in votes for Mr. Ford. Who is making points
297	00:20:02.120	00:20:05.480	on it, do you think, and who is it hurting?
298	00:20:05.490	00:20:08.010	Right now there's very little evidence that anybody is making
299	00:20:08.020	00:20:12.170	points on it. The recently released New York Times-CBS poll
300	00:20:12.180	00:20:15.780	showed that attitudes on abortion were not closely related to
301	00:20:15.790	00:20:19.270	attitudes toward candidates, and that in fact Mr. Carter was
302	00:20:19.280	00:20:23.570	doing better among those who supported a Constitutional amendment banning
303	00:20:23.580	00:20:27.780	abortion than among those who oppose such an amendment. However,
304	00:20:27.790	00:20:30.230	that may change; and in the short run it may,
305	00:20:30.240	00:20:34.540	as Mr. Baker hopes, work to President Ford's advantage, but
306	00:20:34.550	00:20:38.230	in the long run it may cause a backlash among
307	00:20:38.240	00:20:40.420	other voters; so I think it's much too early to
308	00:20:40.430	00:20:42.730	tell who it will help, and we certainly have no
309	00:20:42.740	00:20:45.480	hard evidence on that. I'd like to ask all of
310	00:20:45.490	00:20:48.990	you now, and start with Father Ratigan because I believe
311	00:20:49.000	00:20:51.760	I sensed in an earlier answer the seeds of this
312	00:20:51.770	00:20:56.590	question: do you believe that the pro-life forces are trying
313	00:20:56.600	00:20:59.890	to reach the right people in this campaign? After all,
314	00:20:59.900	00:21:03.030	how much influence does a President actually have on whether
315	00:21:03.040	00:21:09.790	a Constitutional amendment is achieved or not? Our political analyst
316	00:21:09.800	00:21:12.380	could tell us that better. Technically, he has nothing to
317	00:21:12.390	00:21:14.630	do with it; it's the Congress and in the states
318	00:21:14.640	00:21:19.030	that have to ratify; but I think that where we
319	00:21:19.040	00:21:21.750	have to put our emphasis as a church is at
320	00:21:21.760	00:21:24.050	least, in the beginning, at this stage of the game,
321	00:21:24.060	00:21:28.260	anyway--is on our own constituency. We find in polls
322	00:21:28.270	00:21:30.530	that only about a third of the Catholics themselves would
323	00:21:30.540	00:21:34.180	favor a Constitutional amendment at this time. But I think
324	00:21:34.190	00:21:38.500	that our better emphasis--although we're getting visibility because of
325	00:21:38.510	00:21:42.020	what's happening--but the long-range emphasis has to be on
326	00:21:42.030	00:21:44.800	the educational process. Monsignor, what do you think of that,
327	00:21:44.810	00:21:47.570	do you think the short-range publicity may be beneficial in
328	00:21:47.580	00:21:50.870	bringing the issue before the public but, as Father Ratigan
329	00:21:50.880	00:21:55.700	suggests, the long-range issue may not be so beneficial to
330	00:21:55.710	00:21:58.800	the Church following? Yes, I tend to agree with that.
331	00:21:58.810	00:22:01.860	I think that the short-range visibility brings it to the
332	00:22:01.870	00:22:05.690	attention of the whole country; I think that that accomplishes
333	00:22:05.700	00:22:08.040	an added dimension of the bishops` role--the bishops are
334	00:22:08.050	00:22:12.610	concerned, certainly, about reinforcing Catholic teaching for their own people.
335	00:22:12.620	00:22:16.450	But also, as religious leaders in a religiously pluralistic nation
336	00:22:16.460	00:22:20.140	they want to make a contribution to the public morality,
337	00:22:20.150	00:22:24.440	to draw public attention to the tragic consequences of an
338	00:22:24.450	00:22:28.380	abortion-on-request policy, such as we have today. So I think
339	00:22:28.390	00:22:31.890	that the high visibility that it achieves is accomplishing something
340	00:22:31.900	00:22:35.480	now. Our problem, or our challenge, is to make sure
341	00:22:35.490	00:22:38.640	that we are geared for the long-range effort and that
342	00:22:38.650	00:22:41.110	we are able to relate the abortion issue to a
343	00:22:41.120	00:22:44.820	wide variety of human rights issues about which we also
344	00:22:44.830	00:22:49.230	have a continuing concern. Do you agree with what Father
345	00:22:49.240	00:22:55.020	Ratigan said earlier, that Catholics are somewhat less inclined than
346	00:22:55.030	00:22:58.840	they were traditionally to follow instructions from the hierarchy, whether
347	00:22:58.850	00:23:02.750	from Rome or the American Catholic hierarchy, on these social
348	00:23:02.760	00:23:07.840	issues and that a politician who wanted to line up
349	00:23:07.850	00:23:11.380	the Catholic religious grouping on an issue like abortion couldn't
350	00:23:11.390	00:23:14.850	guarantee that simply because the hierarchy wanted them to take
351	00:23:14.860	00:23:17.000	one position they were going to in their private lives
352	00:23:17.010	00:23:20.420	or in their politics? I think we're going through an
353	00:23:20.430	00:23:25.550	experience where the teaching leadership of the Church is having
354	00:23:25.560	00:23:28.560	greater impact than it may have had in recent years.
355	00:23:28.570	00:23:31.630	However, I think that the leadership of the Church, in
356	00:23:31.640	00:23:35.560	fulfilling its role as teachers and as pastors, really is
357	00:23:35.570	00:23:41.000	not seeking to be political leadership at the same time.
358	00:23:41.010	00:23:43.750	So I think that the Catholics are attentive to the
359	00:23:43.760	00:23:47.310	moral teaching of their bishops and priests and I think
360	00:23:47.320	00:23:50.720	that they feel a legitimate freedom in regard to their
361	00:23:50.730	00:23:53.000	political activity, and I think the bishops want it that
362	00:23:53.010	00:23:55.800	way. The bishops are not meeting with Governor Carter or
363	00:23:55.810	00:23:58.870	Mr. Ford in order to endorse a candidate or to
364	00:23:58.880	00:24:02.710	interject this topic into the Presidential race. They have met
365	00:24:02.720	00:24:05.370	with them as candidates, they have spoken to them about
366	00:24:05.380	00:24:08.570	it because it's a highly important topic in our society.
367	00:24:08.580	00:24:11.140	But we have no intention of dictating the choice of
368	00:24:11.150	00:24:15.530	candidates--dictating the electoral choice--for our Roman Catholic people.
369	00:24:15.540	00:24:17.490	We feel that they can do that themselves. Is Mr.
370	00:24:17.500	00:24:20.640	Baker, the President's campaign manager, wrong in saying today the
371	00:24:20.650	00:24:24.070	bishops came out on our side? Yes, I think he's
372	00:24:24.080	00:24:27.200	wrong in saying that we came out on either candidate's
373	00:24:27.210	00:24:31.020	side, or that we came out, particularly, against either candidate.
374	00:24:31.030	00:24:35.350	Obviously, as a political analyst or a political activist, he'd
375	00:24:35.360	00:24:37.590	have a right to say whatever he wants. But we
376	00:24:37.600	00:24:40.480	did not see our role as coming out in favor
377	00:24:40.490	00:24:44.410	of either candidate. We feel that we wanted to call
378	00:24:44.420	00:24:47.030	the seriousness of the attention to both of them in
379	00:24:47.040	00:24:49.270	an emphatic way so that they would realize that it
380	00:24:49.280	00:24:52.870	matters to the Roman Catholic leadership and to their people.
381	00:24:52.880	00:24:56.960	Right. Thank you, Monsignor. Jim? Yes, the polls show, as
382	00:24:56.970	00:24:59.390	we have been talking about, and as Robin said at
383	00:24:59.400	00:25:03.210	the very beginning, that abortion is not now a major
384	00:25:03.220	00:25:05.970	concern of the majority of the voters in this country.
385	00:25:05.980	00:25:07.410	But I would like to ask each one of you
386	00:25:07.420	00:25:09.830	now to look ahead to the election: Could it become
387	00:25:09.840	00:25:12.350	a significant factor in deciding this election? What do you
388	00:25:12.360	00:25:15.160	think, Ms. Stengel? I don't think that it is going
389	00:25:15.170	00:25:18.990	to be the issue that makes up people's minds. There
390	00:25:19.000	00:25:25.050	are, no matter what anybody says, major issues facing Protestant,
391	00:25:25.060	00:25:27.800	Catholic and Jewish voters, and if you want to look
392	00:25:27.810	00:25:31.230	at exactly, for instance, why a Catholic urban voter is
393	00:25:31.240	00:25:34.540	going to make his or her decision, I am convinced
394	00:25:34.550	00:25:37.850	that that voter is going to be more concerned about
395	00:25:37.860	00:25:41.270	the kind of schools that his or her children go
396	00:25:41.280	00:25:45.360	to, whether there's going to be a paycheck coming in
397	00:25:45.370	00:25:47.150	in the next couple of months, whether they will be
398	00:25:47.160	00:25:51.120	able to afford that new car that they want. Abortion
399	00:25:51.130	00:25:56.170	may be one of ten issues that are basic in
400	00:25:56.180	00:25:59.170	the decision but I cannot believe that it makes up
401	00:25:59.180	00:26:02.490	the final decision. Dr. Pressman, what's your view on that
402	00:26:02.500	00:26:04.200	in terms of the long run? I know we put
403	00:26:04.210	00:26:05.790	you on the spot when you were on the program
404	00:26:05.800	00:26:08.030	before, and let me do it again: how important do
405	00:26:08.040	00:26:11.440	you think it's going to be on Election Day? Well,
406	00:26:11.450	00:26:13.590	Mr. Lehrer, I think I will change my position and
407	00:26:13.600	00:26:15.820	say that I think that it might well be a
408	00:26:15.830	00:26:19.400	very important issue on Election Day; it will never rank
409	00:26:19.410	00:26:22.510	very high in the electorate as a whole. Right now
410	00:26:22.520	00:26:25.820	I think Lou Harris finds it 27th of 27 among
411	00:26:25.830	00:26:29.320	issues; however, I think because the polls now show the
412	00:26:29.330	00:26:34.870	results in states like New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Michigan
413	00:26:34.880	00:26:37.770	to be so close, and because those states have a
414	00:26:37.780	00:26:42.390	high percentage of Catholic voters, that that issue may turn
415	00:26:42.400	00:26:45.240	out to be important, not only in and of itself,
416	00:26:45.250	00:26:48.390	but because abortion is also a code word for a
417	00:26:48.400	00:26:52.670	whole set of cultural attitudes. What do you mean by
418	00:26:52.680	00:26:57.840	that? I think that there is an uneasiness that the
419	00:26:57.850	00:27:05.190	polls are finding among northeast industrial state Catholic voters with
420	00:27:05.200	00:27:10.440	Jimmy Carter on a range of lifestyle and other issues.
421	00:27:10.450	00:27:14.360	Somehow, they don't feel comfortable with him; sometimes they can't
422	00:27:14.370	00:27:18.060	express specifically what they don't like, but there does seem
423	00:27:18.070	00:27:22.860	to be a Catholic problem for Jimmy Carter. His support
424	00:27:22.870	00:27:27.030	among Catholics is lower than a Democratic candidate might usually
425	00:27:27.040	00:27:30.050	expect to find and I think that abortion in a
426	00:27:30.060	00:27:38.830	sense is a symbol which voters may view as expressing
427	00:27:38.840	00:27:43.870	some of this uneasiness. I think that issues as Monsignor
428	00:27:43.880	00:27:48.120	McHugh pointed out earlier issues like the economy, and energy
429	00:27:48.130	00:27:53.270	and health care and education are hard, they're intractable, they're
430	00:27:53.280	00:27:59.260	complex. And therefore, symbolic issues like busing and abortion, over
431	00:27:59.270	00:28:01.770	which a President has really very little control--we're electing
432	00:28:01.780	00:28:04.290	a President, not a member of the Supreme Court. A
433	00:28:04.300	00:28:07.420	President doesn't have a great deal to do with the
434	00:28:07.430	00:28:11.040	Constitutional amendment process in those issues, but symbolic issues give
435	00:28:11.050	00:28:14.240	a voter a chance to express how he or she
436	00:28:14.250	00:28:17.760	feels in general, and register a protest, in a sense.
437	00:28:17.770	00:28:20.270	Father Ratigan, let me ask you, not as a political
438	00:28:20.280	00:28:22.350	scientist, but as a man who's around a lot of
439	00:28:22.360	00:28:25.620	Catholics on a regular basis, do you agree with Dr.
440	00:28:25.630	00:28:29.750	Pressman's assessment? Insofar as in those key states, I think
441	00:28:29.760	00:28:31.880	it might have some effect. I think that's what our
442	00:28:31.890	00:28:35.460	Board was concerned about, was that for many of their
443	00:28:35.470	00:28:39.200	people it is not a high-priority issue; that there are
444	00:28:39.210	00:28:41.590	a lot of other issues that the bishops have made
445	00:28:41.600	00:28:44.330	beautiful statements on, but don't seem to be getting the
446	00:28:44.340	00:28:47.600	visibility in this election campaign. And I think that's where
447	00:28:47.610	00:28:51.330	our concern was coming from, that at least, the impression
448	00:28:51.340	00:28:53.740	coming across to the majority of the board members was
449	00:28:53.750	00:28:57.690	that the bishops were kind of testing the candidates on
450	00:28:57.700	00:29:02.210	only one issue. Father McHugh, ten seconds. I think it
451	00:29:02.220	00:29:07.030	will be a highly important factor in some states and
452	00:29:07.040	00:29:09.940	it will be a decisive factor for some people. All
453	00:29:09.950	00:29:13.700	our polls have shown us that for a small percentage
454	00:29:13.710	00:29:16.280	of the electorate it can be a decisive factor, and
455	00:29:16.290	00:29:19.410	in a close race it can be highly important because
456	00:29:19.420	00:29:22.440	of that. That's what you want it to be, right?
457	00:29:22.450	00:29:24.520	No, we don't want it to be the decisive factor
458	00:29:24.530	00:29:26.500	in the choice of candidates; we want people to be
459	00:29:26.510	00:29:28.250	better aware of it so that we can carry the
460	00:29:28.260	00:29:31.940	long-range Congressional battle. Thank you, Monsignor. Robin? Yes. Thanks, Jim,
461	00:29:31.950	00:29:33.800	and thank you all very much. Jim Lehrer and I
462	00:29:33.810	00:31:10.424	will be back tomorrow evening. I'm Robert MacNeil. Good night.
