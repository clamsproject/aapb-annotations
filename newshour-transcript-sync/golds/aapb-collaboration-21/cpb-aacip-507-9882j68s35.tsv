1	00:02:52.290	00:02:54.960	Good evening. A man walked into a bank in Brooklyn
2	00:02:54.970	00:02:58.200	yesterday intending to stage a holdup, and he shoved a
3	00:02:58.210	00:03:00.860	note at a woman teller. She shoved it back because
4	00:03:00.870	00:03:03.570	it was so badly written that she couldn't understand it.
5	00:03:03.580	00:03:05.540	By the time he went to rewrite it the alarms
6	00:03:05.550	00:03:07.970	were ringing. So even to hold up a bank a
7	00:03:07.980	00:03:11.110	certain amount of English grammar may be necessary today. To
8	00:03:11.120	00:03:14.160	many the decline of basic proficiency in English has reached
9	00:03:14.170	00:03:17.890	crisis proportions and is most disturbing in college. Here are
10	00:03:17.900	00:03:23.020	some examples from student compositions. One freshman wrote: "College also
11	00:03:23.030	00:03:26.140	brondens your views, helps you kop with things you will
12	00:03:26.150	00:03:30.160	face in the furture." Another student wrote: "In years or
13	00:03:30.170	00:03:34.030	Centrys ago people was dying because their minds were lazy
14	00:03:34.040	00:03:36.170	they believed in a lot of supersticion because they could
15	00:03:36.180	00:03:38.260	not think of any other reason for what was happening
16	00:03:38.270	00:03:42.990	to them." A third year college student discussing apathy asked:
17	00:03:43.000	00:03:46.400	"Could it be an inherent personality trait mutating from some
18	00:03:46.410	00:03:50.250	previous episode which created such a deviated atmosphere, or is
19	00:03:50.260	00:03:52.810	it by nature of the vast numbers of people walking
20	00:03:52.820	00:03:56.770	this earth today and their seemingly insurmountable task of constructive
21	00:03:56.780	00:04:01.960	interaction or interrelation?" Tonight we examine what many authorities are
22	00:04:01.970	00:04:05.290	calling the crisis in college writing skills: The reasons for
23	00:04:05.300	00:04:08.590	it, the remedies, and whether in fact such skills really
24	00:04:08.600	00:04:12.790	matter anymore. Jim? Robin, the evidence that something has gone
25	00:04:12.800	00:04:16.770	wrong with college level writing goes like this. Nationally, verbal
26	00:04:16.780	00:04:20.760	scores in the major, college entrance examination, the Scholastic Aptitude
27	00:04:20.770	00:04:25.600	Test or SAT, has fallen 45 points since 1965, from
28	00:04:25.610	00:04:31.060	478 to 434. At Ohio State University last year, 30%
29	00:04:31.070	00:04:35.220	of the freshmen were rated "unprepared to perform college level
30	00:04:35.230	00:04:39.440	writing tasks." Other colleges and universities all over the country
31	00:04:39.450	00:04:42.880	are saying similar if not worse things about their freshmen.
32	00:04:42.890	00:04:46.820	Many schools have reinstated stricter writing requirements, and enrollment in
33	00:04:46.830	00:04:51.390	remedial writing courses called bonehead English is booming. Students think
34	00:04:51.400	00:04:54.030	it's a problem too. They also have some theories on
35	00:04:54.040	00:04:58.010	why it's happening. There's no doubt that there's been a
36	00:04:58.020	00:05:00.920	decline in skills. I see it all around me. In
37	00:05:00.930	00:05:04.270	high school and in college all the signs are there
38	00:05:04.280	00:05:08.070	that this country is facing a full-scale, educational disaster. And
39	00:05:08.080	00:05:11.610	that isn't an exaggeration. I see around me students who
40	00:05:11.620	00:05:15.350	have gone through the educational process and absolutely are not
41	00:05:15.360	00:05:19.440	capable to function in society. They're functionally illiterate. I think
42	00:05:19.450	00:05:23.400	it's due to a decline in reading skills. There's a
43	00:05:23.410	00:05:30.240	paucity of reading, teaching correctly--of the ability to read
44	00:05:30.250	00:05:35.180	correctly, I should say, among students in early elementary school.
45	00:05:35.190	00:05:37.940	Therefore, by the time they reach college level they can't
46	00:05:37.950	00:05:40.240	read, so they can not write. I don't know. That
47	00:05:40.250	00:05:42.130	may be so. It's just--but it may have to
48	00:05:42.140	00:05:45.180	do with more people going to college too, that, you
49	00:05:45.190	00:05:47.850	know, colleges, you know, may be less selective in who they
50	00:05:47.860	00:05:51.060	choose and in more people going. It's a difficult problem
51	00:05:51.070	00:05:54.370	because I think writing requires a terrific amount of discipline,
52	00:05:54.380	00:05:57.940	and today discipline is not emphasized, you know. In our
53	00:05:57.950	00:06:06.000	culture it's something that's...Because of increased freedom the discipline
54	00:06:06.010	00:06:10.370	has suffered. My personal feelings are that it has something
55	00:06:10.380	00:06:16.110	to do with television and a general lack of emphasis
56	00:06:16.120	00:06:19.830	on written skills. In general people make telephone calls; they
57	00:06:19.840	00:06:22.360	watch TV. They don't read books. I mean we are
58	00:06:22.370	00:06:28.050	turning into a verbal society that's nonliterate. One man who
59	00:06:28.060	00:06:30.870	has been keeping an eye on college level writing skills
60	00:06:30.880	00:06:34.310	from the inside is Dr. James Scanlon, chairman of freshman
61	00:06:34.320	00:06:37.220	rhetoric at the University of Illinois, and a veteran college
62	00:06:37.230	00:06:40.780	English teacher. Dr. Scanlon, from your perspective, how serious is
63	00:06:40.790	00:06:43.440	this problem? Well, while the problem is certainly not a
64	00:06:43.450	00:06:46.460	new problem, there is increasing evidence that over the last
65	00:06:46.470	00:06:49.500	several years, 10 to 12 years, and even particularly in
66	00:06:49.510	00:06:52.290	the last five years, that the writing skills problem has
67	00:06:52.300	00:06:58.070	become much worse. Why now? It's a difficult question to
68	00:06:58.080	00:07:01.780	answer. The reasons for it have been suggested all over
69	00:07:01.790	00:07:05.490	the place from Watergate to Mayor Daly. But in fact
70	00:07:05.500	00:07:07.610	I think...Now wait a minute. How do they blame
71	00:07:07.620	00:07:13.100	writing skills on Watergate? The NCT, for instance, feels that
72	00:07:13.110	00:07:17.560	government double-speak had reached its height during Watergate, and that
73	00:07:17.570	00:07:20.210	students would have seen that material, and having seen that
74	00:07:20.220	00:07:22.560	material might have been influenced by it. I think what
75	00:07:22.570	00:07:24.950	I am trying to say is that the answer to
76	00:07:24.960	00:07:27.620	the question is not simple. People who have blamed Watergate
77	00:07:27.630	00:07:31.300	and Mayor Daly I think are a little further from
78	00:07:31.310	00:07:33.740	the point. The fact of the matter is that over
79	00:07:33.750	00:07:37.620	the last 12 or 15 years apparently writing skills at
80	00:07:37.630	00:07:41.330	all levels of education, particularly I think at the high
81	00:07:41.340	00:07:44.370	school level and at the college level, have been treated
82	00:07:44.380	00:07:47.710	with benign neglect. I think we are reaping the fruits
83	00:07:47.720	00:07:50.630	of that benign neglect now; we have students entering college
84	00:07:50.640	00:07:53.640	who are ill-prepared. We have, I think, students leaving college
85	00:07:53.650	00:07:56.930	who are ill-prepared. The first group ill-prepared for us; the
86	00:07:56.940	00:07:59.820	second group I'm afraid ill-prepared for their professions and their
87	00:07:59.830	00:08:04.410	business and professional life. What caused the benign neglect? Well,
88	00:08:04.420	00:08:07.080	I'm not exactly certain what cause I would attribute to
89	00:08:07.090	00:08:08.930	the benign neglect, but I think there were changes in
90	00:08:08.940	00:08:12.680	education in the 1960's. There was, quite rightly, I think,
91	00:08:12.690	00:08:16.380	a reexamination of most things in this country, in particular
92	00:08:16.390	00:08:20.030	education. There was a desire to increase the positive classroom
93	00:08:20.040	00:08:23.450	atmosphere, to draw more on individuality in the classroom. That
94	00:08:23.460	00:08:25.690	means an open classroom, in other words. Well, not inevitably
95	00:08:25.700	00:08:27.810	an open classroom. More freedom though. But more freedom in
96	00:08:27.820	00:08:30.710	the classroom. Or as the student just said, there is
97	00:08:30.720	00:08:32.490	not the discipline that there used to be, and that's
98	00:08:32.500	00:08:35.780	what he meant, right? Yes. In fact, I think the
99	00:08:35.790	00:08:38.830	problem became that a polarity was set up where the
100	00:08:38.840	00:08:41.820	understanding was that in order to have individuality and individual
101	00:08:41.830	00:08:45.460	freedom in the classroom, we had to take all that
102	00:08:45.470	00:08:47.900	we used to do and get rid of it. The
103	00:08:47.910	00:08:50.310	problem, I think, was that we weren't able to accommodate
104	00:08:50.320	00:08:52.410	the old with the new, and it seems to me
105	00:08:52.420	00:08:55.040	at this point that's the point of view that we
106	00:08:55.050	00:08:56.690	are coming around to, and that is that we must
107	00:08:56.700	00:08:58.170	be able to accommodate the old and new, and I
108	00:08:58.180	00:09:01.160	think we can. Based on your experience and on what
109	00:09:01.170	00:09:04.870	you have found out that has happened at other colleges
110	00:09:04.880	00:09:08.800	and universities, is this problem affect all kinds of students,
111	00:09:08.810	00:09:12.330	or a particular kind depending on economic background or whatever?
112	00:09:12.340	00:09:16.440	No. I think that the problem goes across all social
113	00:09:16.450	00:09:19.600	and economic backgrounds. Whether you look at public universities which
114	00:09:19.610	00:09:22.970	have open admission programs, public universities which have fairly selective
115	00:09:22.980	00:09:26.280	programs, or even private universities, you find the same kinds
116	00:09:26.290	00:09:31.970	of problems. Berkeley, Texas have found that the exemption rate
117	00:09:31.980	00:09:34.500	for freshman composition is down to a third or below.
118	00:09:34.510	00:09:36.820	Harvard and Cornell have doubled the money that they are
119	00:09:36.830	00:09:40.100	willing to spend on freshman composition. So, no matter where
120	00:09:40.110	00:09:42.310	you look, public or private, I think if you look
121	00:09:42.320	00:09:44.900	at the students' writing itself, you will find that economic
122	00:09:44.910	00:09:47.930	group, place of origin whether it's rural or city or
123	00:09:47.940	00:09:50.670	suburban has nothing directly to do with what you are
124	00:09:50.680	00:09:54.220	going to see. Thank you, Doctor. Robin? But how do
125	00:09:54.230	00:09:57.600	we judge good writing from bad? Some feel that questionable
126	00:09:57.610	00:10:00.430	standards, not inadequate skills may be at the bottom of
127	00:10:00.440	00:10:04.790	the current, so-called crisis. Minority groups suggest that standard, written
128	00:10:04.800	00:10:08.680	English is biased against them and their cultural heritage. Others
129	00:10:08.690	00:10:11.720	believe that time and technology are changing the language. What
130	00:10:11.730	00:10:16.630	was standard ten years ago isn't necessarily best today. If
131	00:10:16.640	00:10:20.430	you come from a predominantly black background as I do,
132	00:10:20.440	00:10:25.400	obviously, and your parents may not be from a particular
133	00:10:25.410	00:10:30.270	socioeconomic background, and you're influenced by your environment, and you're
134	00:10:30.280	00:10:33.870	going to talk the way people around you talk. When
135	00:10:33.880	00:10:35.820	you get into a situation, you go to college and
136	00:10:35.830	00:10:39.270	things of that nature, you're forced to talk the way
137	00:10:39.280	00:10:41.520	that they want you to talk, and subsequently you're forced
138	00:10:41.530	00:10:45.170	to write the way that they want you to write.
139	00:10:45.180	00:10:49.230	I think it's not overt racism or elitism or anything
140	00:10:49.240	00:10:50.940	like that. I just think that's the way it's mapped
141	00:10:50.950	00:10:53.310	out by society. I know for myself, and I'm a
142	00:10:53.320	00:10:55.750	bio major, and I spend a lot of time learning
143	00:10:55.760	00:10:59.440	equations, and I don't learn English language, so the things
144	00:10:59.450	00:11:03.600	that I'm learning I communicate with people that communicate in
145	00:11:03.610	00:11:06.410	my language, but I don't communicate in theirs necessarily. And
146	00:11:06.420	00:11:09.520	I think that's a reflection of how the society is
147	00:11:09.530	00:11:15.530	becoming more specialized and diversified. And when you have specialists,
148	00:11:15.540	00:11:18.820	when you have people going into different fields, they are
149	00:11:18.830	00:11:21.700	going to be talking different languages. And I don't know
150	00:11:21.710	00:11:23.700	what the basic English language is that people want to
151	00:11:23.710	00:11:28.440	teach anymore. Dr. Jasper Neel is the Director of English
152	00:11:28.450	00:11:31.710	programs for the Modern Language Association in New York. He
153	00:11:31.720	00:11:34.670	has also taught composition at the University of Tennessee and
154	00:11:34.680	00:11:37.500	at Baylor University. Dr. Neel, how do you react to
155	00:11:37.510	00:11:39.650	those two points the last two students were making, the
156	00:11:39.660	00:11:43.830	ethnic background and the sort of technological specialization points? Well,
157	00:11:43.840	00:11:46.400	I think there is no question that someone from an
158	00:11:46.410	00:11:50.470	ethnic background where what we would call standard, upper-middle class,
159	00:11:50.480	00:11:52.720	white English is not spoken, is at a disadvantage when
160	00:11:52.730	00:11:55.750	he goes to college and has to write upper-middle class,
161	00:11:55.760	00:11:59.440	standard, white dialect in that he's not simply putting cosmetics
162	00:11:59.450	00:12:02.030	on a face that already exists, he's got to develop
163	00:12:02.040	00:12:03.960	a new face in more ways than one. The metaphor
164	00:12:03.970	00:12:06.700	works in a lot of different ways. To the second
165	00:12:06.710	00:12:10.670	person I would say that probably what he means is
166	00:12:10.680	00:12:12.770	that in his chemistry courses, or his biology courses, or
167	00:12:12.780	00:12:16.680	his math courses that he can assimilate the information that
168	00:12:16.690	00:12:18.460	the teachers give him and communicate it back to the
169	00:12:18.470	00:12:21.520	teachers in a form that the teachers can decipher, that
170	00:12:21.530	00:12:24.060	he can tell them what they already know. And I
171	00:12:24.070	00:12:26.680	would contend that writing is telling someone who doesn't know
172	00:12:26.690	00:12:29.740	what you know what you know. And so, someone who
173	00:12:29.750	00:12:31.900	can only speak to those people who already know what
174	00:12:31.910	00:12:34.490	he knows has got no real skill at all in
175	00:12:34.500	00:12:37.050	writing. But there's another more important thing that needs to
176	00:12:37.060	00:12:40.710	be brought up, and that is the word crisis. I
177	00:12:40.720	00:12:44.160	think that sometimes raises a false sense of insecurity throughout
178	00:12:44.170	00:12:49.160	the country. If we mean by crisis that college students
179	00:12:49.170	00:12:50.770	and high school students don't write as well as we
180	00:12:50.780	00:12:53.620	wish they could write, then certainly we do have a
181	00:12:53.630	00:12:57.540	crisis. But if we mean by crisis that something dramatic
182	00:12:57.550	00:13:00.180	has happened then we don't have a good sense of
183	00:13:00.190	00:13:04.690	historical perspective. For example, in 1960, 55% of all colleges
184	00:13:04.700	00:13:10.120	and universities offered remedial writing courses. In 1967, just ten
185	00:13:10.130	00:13:12.820	years ago, 93% of all colleges and universities, and I
186	00:13:12.830	00:13:14.900	don't even include two year colleges in this. All colleges
187	00:13:14.910	00:13:17.940	and universities required at least one term of composition, and
188	00:13:17.950	00:13:21.900	77%, or well over 3/4 required a whole year. So
189	00:13:21.910	00:13:24.420	the aberration from the norm is not that we are
190	00:13:24.430	00:13:28.060	finding ourselves required to have remedial writing and required composition
191	00:13:28.070	00:13:30.810	in college today. The aberration from the norm was in
192	00:13:30.820	00:13:33.960	the late 60's when we chose to abolish those requirements.
193	00:13:33.970	00:13:37.980	Yeah. Well, why are people so upset now? One of
194	00:13:37.990	00:13:40.130	the reasons that they are upset is because of the
195	00:13:40.140	00:13:44.540	reports of the national tests. For example, the SAT does
196	00:13:44.550	00:13:47.420	not, as it was administered in the most recent past,
197	00:13:47.430	00:13:50.630	does not include a writing sample. And while you can
198	00:13:50.640	00:13:53.240	probably predict to some degree how well a student can
199	00:13:53.250	00:13:56.860	write by giving him a multiple choice test, determining how
200	00:13:56.870	00:13:59.070	well he writes entirely by multiple choice test would be
201	00:13:59.080	00:14:00.790	a lot like determining how well he can ice skate
202	00:14:00.800	00:14:02.650	by multiple choice test. The only real way to find
203	00:14:02.660	00:14:03.890	out whether or not he can ice skate is to
204	00:14:03.900	00:14:05.020	give him some skates and send him out on the
205	00:14:05.030	00:14:06.840	ice. The only way to find out whether or not
206	00:14:06.850	00:14:08.170	he can write is to give him a pencil and
207	00:14:08.180	00:14:13.000	ask him to write. So that while the nationwide tests
208	00:14:13.010	00:14:17.770	do have some effectiveness, and they are very useful, we
209	00:14:17.780	00:14:20.180	shouldn't be too concerned if people don't do well on
210	00:14:20.190	00:14:22.540	multiple choice tests. Is it your impression with your own
211	00:14:22.550	00:14:26.640	historical perspective that, on average, students in college and high
212	00:14:26.650	00:14:31.310	school are writing as well today as they did in
213	00:14:31.320	00:14:34.910	the 50's or the 40's or whenever? I'll have to
214	00:14:34.920	00:14:36.810	plead ignorance there. I don't know how students wrote in
215	00:14:36.820	00:14:38.320	the 50's and the 40's. Certainly not in the 40's.
216	00:14:38.330	00:14:42.340	I wasn't even born until 1946. I've only taught composition
217	00:14:42.350	00:14:44.230	for six years, and I...You were the one who
218	00:14:44.240	00:14:47.110	introduced historical perspective, and I wonder if you had a
219	00:14:47.120	00:14:50.200	premise for...Ah! I see what you mean. My premise
220	00:14:50.210	00:14:53.660	there is this. Composition was required in the 40's, and
221	00:14:53.670	00:14:57.020	that remedial writing was offered in the 40's. Yale had
222	00:14:57.030	00:14:59.840	its awkward squad way back in the 20's. And if
223	00:14:59.850	00:15:02.290	there was required composition, a year of required composition, and
224	00:15:02.300	00:15:04.830	if over half the colleges offered remedial writing, I would
225	00:15:04.840	00:15:07.570	presume that those people who read the writing of college
226	00:15:07.580	00:15:10.260	students assumed that they needed required composition and that many
227	00:15:10.270	00:15:14.110	of them needed remedial composition. I see. While there is
228	00:15:14.120	00:15:16.960	disagreement about the nature and extent of the college writing
229	00:15:16.970	00:15:19.620	problem, there's no disagreement about the need to improve the
230	00:15:19.630	00:15:23.160	teaching of writing. Colleges are beefing up their composition courses.
231	00:15:23.170	00:15:27.100	Cornell University recently appointed its first Dean of Writing. But
232	00:15:27.110	00:15:31.760	remedial medicine at the college level may be too little
233	00:15:31.770	00:15:35.410	too late. The Bay Area Writing Project tackles the job
234	00:15:35.420	00:15:39.370	of teaching writing skills in the elementary and secondary schools.
235	00:15:39.380	00:15:42.270	James Gray is director of the project. He founded the
236	00:15:42.280	00:15:44.580	program three years ago at the Berkeley campus of the
237	00:15:44.590	00:15:50.470	University of California. Mr. Gray, does your program assume bad
238	00:15:50.480	00:15:53.820	teaching or just a lack of background in English at
239	00:15:53.830	00:15:58.680	home? I don't think it assumes either. There are causes
240	00:15:58.690	00:16:00.370	for the writing problem, but we try to address what
241	00:16:00.380	00:16:03.210	we can, do something about it with the project, and
242	00:16:03.220	00:16:06.040	that is the quality of the teaching in the schools.
243	00:16:06.050	00:16:08.050	From the amount of writing that teachers are given as
244	00:16:08.060	00:16:10.610	they move in through the colleges and become teachers themselves,
245	00:16:10.620	00:16:14.850	there is very little training of teacher composition. If the
246	00:16:14.860	00:16:16.760	English major is a major primarily in the history of
247	00:16:16.770	00:16:21.260	literature, we do not really teach composition skills to elementary
248	00:16:21.270	00:16:23.780	teachers as widely as we should. Secondary teachers are trained
249	00:16:23.790	00:16:26.930	as literature teachers. College professors are obviously trained in the
250	00:16:26.940	00:16:29.900	history of literature. There's been a neglect in the training
251	00:16:29.910	00:16:32.660	of the English teachers. Now, the way we try to
252	00:16:32.670	00:16:35.450	attack this is we try to identify those teachers in
253	00:16:35.460	00:16:38.710	the elementary schools, middle schools, senior high schools and colleges
254	00:16:38.720	00:16:42.340	who are having some success teaching composition for whatever reason,
255	00:16:42.350	00:16:44.860	and the teachers who are successful approach it in a
256	00:16:44.870	00:16:47.830	variety of ways. We bring these people together as a
257	00:16:47.840	00:16:50.130	core for five weeks in the summer time, and we
258	00:16:50.140	00:16:53.450	train them as consultants by having them teach each other
259	00:16:53.460	00:16:55.830	what they know...about the teaching of composition and have
260	00:16:55.840	00:16:57.970	them write a great deal themselves, feeling that the English
261	00:16:57.980	00:17:00.630	teacher at any level ought to be if not master
262	00:17:00.640	00:17:03.580	of the craft at least practicing it constantly so he
263	00:17:03.590	00:17:06.030	is aware of what he is asking students to do,
264	00:17:06.040	00:17:07.910	aware of the problems students face when they are asked
265	00:17:07.920	00:17:11.600	to write. What do the successful teachers of English composition
266	00:17:11.610	00:17:16.060	do that the unsuccessful ones don't? What do they emphasize
267	00:17:16.070	00:17:19.600	and what's the difference? The one thing I've been able
268	00:17:19.610	00:17:21.030	to point out over three or four years of the
269	00:17:21.040	00:17:23.890	project that seems to identify all of the successful teachers
270	00:17:23.900	00:17:26.280	is that they seem to know why they're doing what
271	00:17:26.290	00:17:30.360	they are doing. Their courses have pattern, have focus. You
272	00:17:30.370	00:17:34.130	can look back and see sequence. They come at it,
273	00:17:34.140	00:17:37.370	as I said, in various ways. Some will emphasize grammar;
274	00:17:37.380	00:17:40.990	some will emphasize diction; some will emphasize writing to audiences;
275	00:17:41.000	00:17:45.520	some will emphasize point of view. But the emphasis is
276	00:17:45.530	00:17:48.080	something that they're passionate about. They know why they are
277	00:17:48.090	00:17:50.270	doing what they're doing, and that seems to be what's
278	00:17:50.280	00:17:54.940	important. Right now I wouldn't say that this approach is
279	00:17:54.950	00:17:57.500	necessarily better than this approach. I see. It's making it
280	00:17:57.510	00:17:59.300	seem important to the students as well. If the teacher
281	00:17:59.310	00:18:02.270	has that passion it'll come across to the students. Obviously
282	00:18:02.280	00:18:03.410	there is a great deal of writing going on in
283	00:18:03.420	00:18:06.640	all of these approaches. Where does the chief lack seem
284	00:18:06.650	00:18:10.050	to be in students' writing skills that these teachers cope
285	00:18:10.060	00:18:14.420	with? When we look at papers at Berkeley--we look
286	00:18:14.430	00:18:17.100	at a lot of papers of entering freshmen--it seems
287	00:18:17.110	00:18:19.100	to me that most of the errors are really errors
288	00:18:19.110	00:18:24.130	of lack of experience. Lack of experience in writing, not
289	00:18:24.140	00:18:27.500	of life. Lack of experience in writing. We can put
290	00:18:27.510	00:18:29.950	failing papers in two piles. One pile, the smaller of
291	00:18:29.960	00:18:34.030	the two, indicates seemingly to me with papers that start
292	00:18:34.040	00:18:36.360	out, "I am a 17 year old boy, and I
293	00:18:36.370	00:18:38.080	will write from the point of view of a 17
294	00:18:38.090	00:18:41.300	year old boy," or "This paper is true for 12
295	00:18:41.310	00:18:46.310	reasons." The poor kids have not had much experience writing
296	00:18:46.320	00:18:50.180	about ideas on paper with words. The other paper, the
297	00:18:50.190	00:18:54.180	other pile, larger, is papers filled with gross error. But
298	00:18:54.190	00:18:58.810	even there, looking closely at the kinds of errors, we
299	00:18:58.820	00:19:02.560	get a sense of what it is they haven't been
300	00:19:02.570	00:19:06.820	working with. They haven't been working with their minds. They
301	00:19:06.830	00:19:09.130	might have been asked to write a great deal, but
302	00:19:09.140	00:19:11.980	we want them to not only write, but write also
303	00:19:11.990	00:19:14.000	about ideas. We're trying to get a movement. They haven't
304	00:19:14.010	00:19:18.560	been forced to address and manipulate abstract ideas? Enough. It
305	00:19:18.570	00:19:20.310	seems to be a lack. I'm not going to say
306	00:19:20.320	00:19:25.110	that we shouldn't start necessarily, you know, old fashioned, strict
307	00:19:25.120	00:19:31.160	kind of essay, 500 words essay every Friday. We're trying
308	00:19:31.170	00:19:32.940	to get a way to have the students become writers.
309	00:19:32.950	00:19:34.710	We're going to have them tap their own experiences. We're
310	00:19:34.720	00:19:37.490	going to move them from that, writing about experience to
311	00:19:37.500	00:19:39.890	writing about ideas. If we can make that kind of
312	00:19:39.900	00:19:44.920	separation there, and that's an awkward one. But writing some
313	00:19:44.930	00:19:49.770	assessment about or some analysis of; movement to analytical prose
314	00:19:49.780	00:19:53.280	seems to be missing. Thank you. Jim? There is much
315	00:19:53.290	00:19:57.070	discussion and disagreement over how writing skills should be taught.
316	00:19:57.080	00:19:59.460	Hit grammar hard as in the old days when MacNeil
317	00:19:59.470	00:20:02.230	and others were in school, or aim for more organization
318	00:20:02.240	00:20:04.980	and coherence of thought and so on. Students have their
319	00:20:04.990	00:20:09.210	own thoughts about what is important too. I think grammar
320	00:20:09.220	00:20:14.210	is essential to good writing. I mean if you can't
321	00:20:14.220	00:20:19.580	express yourself in an articulate, clear fashion, using the language
322	00:20:19.590	00:20:23.880	as it is meant to be used, then I don't
323	00:20:23.890	00:20:27.150	think you are using the English language well. Grammar is
324	00:20:27.160	00:20:29.980	important, but it's not as important as learning to get
325	00:20:29.990	00:20:35.400	your ideas down. It's more important to know how to
326	00:20:35.410	00:20:40.820	write, you know, your feelings and then correct the grammar
327	00:20:40.830	00:20:44.280	and the spelling. They're trying to find a happy medium
328	00:20:44.290	00:20:48.330	between giving the old, you know, routine, structural doctrine of
329	00:20:48.340	00:20:53.720	grammar and having a new, sort of individualized and more
330	00:20:53.730	00:20:56.900	liberalized approach. There's got to be some in between place.
331	00:20:56.910	00:20:59.430	You know you can't have it so dogmatic that the
332	00:20:59.440	00:21:01.810	student is going to get turned off, and you can't
333	00:21:01.820	00:21:04.630	have it so free and easy that the student just
334	00:21:04.640	00:21:10.300	doesn't do anything. Gentlemen, let's explore some of the ideas
335	00:21:10.310	00:21:14.210	that those three students raised. Beginning with you, Dr. Scanlon.
336	00:21:14.220	00:21:16.820	The first student said that grammar is essential to good
337	00:21:16.830	00:21:19.840	writing; the second one said grammar is not as important
338	00:21:19.850	00:21:22.990	as learning to get your ideas down. Where do you
339	00:21:23.000	00:21:25.160	come down? Well, it seems to me that you can
340	00:21:25.170	00:21:29.600	make an accommodation between the rubrics, basic rubrics, basics of
341	00:21:29.610	00:21:35.220	the language, and writing itself. The research in the field
342	00:21:35.230	00:21:38.780	seems to indicate fairly clearly that the teaching of formal
343	00:21:38.790	00:21:41.480	grammar may end up with the student knowing far more
344	00:21:41.490	00:21:44.270	grammar, but it does not inevitably transfer into the student's
345	00:21:44.280	00:21:47.820	own writing. There is growing...You mean there is evidence
346	00:21:47.830	00:21:51.100	that says that there is no correlation between knowing grammar
347	00:21:51.110	00:21:54.410	and writing well. Very little correlation, and in comparison to
348	00:21:54.420	00:21:57.250	the amount of effort expended, the effort might well be
349	00:21:57.260	00:21:59.680	expended better in another way. And in fact that other
350	00:21:59.690	00:22:02.580	way is to work functionally to work through the writing
351	00:22:02.590	00:22:06.760	process itself. In fact the real problem with student writing...
352	00:22:06.770	00:22:08.670	Excuse me. How can you do that, Doctor, if you
353	00:22:08.680	00:22:11.310	don't have a basic knowledge of the grammar or the
354	00:22:11.320	00:22:14.040	basic knowledge of the language to use it? Most students
355	00:22:14.050	00:22:17.780	have some rudimentary knowledge of the language. They have it
356	00:22:17.790	00:22:20.860	largely from the community in which they grew up. They
357	00:22:20.870	00:22:23.110	get some of it from school. They get it from
358	00:22:23.120	00:22:25.280	the media. They get it from various places. If you
359	00:22:25.290	00:22:28.590	start students writing, you can work with their own writing,
360	00:22:28.600	00:22:31.690	with something that means something directly to them; ask them
361	00:22:31.700	00:22:34.100	to clarify it. Teach them about some of the basic
362	00:22:34.110	00:22:37.170	forms of expression. In fact, from my own point of
363	00:22:37.180	00:22:40.510	view, the basic problem with student writing is that students
364	00:22:40.520	00:22:42.920	do not have a sense of the potential of the
365	00:22:42.930	00:22:45.610	language, and the potential of the language really doesn't come
366	00:22:45.620	00:22:48.940	in being able to identify an adverbial clause. The potential
367	00:22:48.950	00:22:51.830	of the language comes in being able to write well,
368	00:22:51.840	00:22:55.530	and that means sentences. That means coordination, subordination and bedding
369	00:22:55.540	00:22:59.120	in sentences. That means paragraphs, being able to work deductively
370	00:22:59.130	00:23:02.250	and inductively in paragraphs. It means organizing essays as a
371	00:23:02.260	00:23:04.840	whole. But if you start with the writing you can
372	00:23:04.850	00:23:07.930	work to the grammar, to the usage elements of the
373	00:23:07.940	00:23:11.990	language through the writing. If you start with the grammar
374	00:23:12.000	00:23:14.220	quite frequently what you do is you end up with
375	00:23:14.230	00:23:16.460	the grammar. In fact a study that I did last
376	00:23:16.470	00:23:18.750	summer would seem to indicate that even those students who
377	00:23:18.760	00:23:22.480	score very high on the ACT, English portion of national
378	00:23:22.490	00:23:28.580	testing, 27 ACT English scores are in a position where
379	00:23:28.590	00:23:31.700	good grasp of grammar and usage does not provide them
380	00:23:31.710	00:23:35.140	with good writing skills, with good and varied sentence structure,
381	00:23:35.150	00:23:37.320	with a firm sense of paragraphing, with a firm sense
382	00:23:37.330	00:23:40.030	of the logic of the essay as a whole. How
383	00:23:40.040	00:23:42.600	do you feel about that, Dr. Neel? Well, I agree
384	00:23:42.610	00:23:45.670	with Dr. Scanlon almost wholeheartedly. There is a fairly even
385	00:23:45.680	00:23:49.380	split between teachers of composition as to how one can
386	00:23:49.390	00:23:53.230	approach it. The first and the oldest and perhaps the
387	00:23:53.240	00:23:55.600	most widely adhered to school is that an idea can
388	00:23:55.610	00:23:58.200	exist in the abstract, and that there are many different
389	00:23:58.210	00:24:01.590	ways that the idea can be embodied; that the writer
390	00:24:01.600	00:24:03.120	has a choice of a lot of different ways to
391	00:24:03.130	00:24:06.830	express his idea. And the other approach is--that first
392	00:24:06.840	00:24:09.640	approach I suppose could be called rhetorical dualism. The second
393	00:24:09.650	00:24:13.080	approach is sort of a psychological monism that an idea
394	00:24:13.090	00:24:14.300	is inseparable from the way it's expressed. I think you
395	00:24:14.310	00:24:17.830	are going to have to explain that for me. What...
396	00:24:17.840	00:24:20.190	Pardon? Those two terms. I'm sorry. You lost me there.
397	00:24:20.200	00:24:23.210	What I mean by dualism is that an idea can
398	00:24:23.220	00:24:25.810	be expressed in more than one way. Okay. Monism, that
399	00:24:25.820	00:24:27.610	it can only be expressed one way; that the idea
400	00:24:27.620	00:24:31.280	itself is inseparable from the language. The way it's expressed.
401	00:24:31.290	00:24:32.990	I see. Right. That the writer as he writes is
402	00:24:33.000	00:24:35.890	refining and clarifying the idea. And there is another thing.
403	00:24:35.900	00:24:37.960	You seemed to be a little bit incredulous when Dr.
404	00:24:37.970	00:24:42.020	Scanlon said you could teach writing without having taught grammar
405	00:24:42.030	00:24:45.610	first. That shouldn't be so surprising because the words themselves
406	00:24:45.620	00:24:48.930	should tip you off. Composition is really the process of
407	00:24:48.940	00:24:52.670	composing, and the fine point of grammar is an analysis.
408	00:24:52.680	00:24:55.040	And so you're asking the student to do two different,
409	00:24:55.050	00:24:58.050	mental processes, the first one first. You want him to
410	00:24:58.060	00:25:00.990	analyze before he has composed. It's sort of like dissecting
411	00:25:01.000	00:25:04.980	a cadaver before it exists. The two of them are
412	00:25:04.990	00:25:07.960	rather different processes. Well, right. We were talking about the
413	00:25:07.970	00:25:12.430	teaching of it, but my basic exclamation was to the
414	00:25:12.440	00:25:16.450	point that you had to have these tools before you
415	00:25:16.460	00:25:19.490	could actually use the language. I mean, to express an
416	00:25:19.500	00:25:21.670	idea you got to know what the words are, and
417	00:25:21.680	00:25:24.110	what order to put them in; some basic things. Right.
418	00:25:24.120	00:25:26.590	Everyone has an idea of how to use the language
419	00:25:26.600	00:25:28.310	when he goes to college. In fact everyone who goes
420	00:25:28.320	00:25:31.340	to the first grade can already talk, and so we
421	00:25:31.350	00:25:34.730	already have a basic grasp of grammar. The point is
422	00:25:34.740	00:25:36.510	what do you mean by grammar? Do you mean by
423	00:25:36.520	00:25:39.220	grammar that when someone writes he must know never to
424	00:25:39.230	00:25:41.820	link two, independent clauses with a comma; always to have
425	00:25:41.830	00:25:45.900	a coordinating conjunction? Do you mean that when in the
426	00:25:45.910	00:25:48.150	objective case one should always use whom? For example, you
427	00:25:48.160	00:25:51.030	wouldn't say to your wife, "With whom are we eating
428	00:25:51.040	00:25:52.620	tonight?" She'd look at you like you were crazy. You'd
429	00:25:52.630	00:25:54.450	say, "Who are we going to eat with?" Right. Let's
430	00:25:54.460	00:25:57.820	go to Robert MacNeil who is probably even more incredulous
431	00:25:57.830	00:26:01.060	than I am. Robin? Churchill said, "That is the kind
432	00:26:01.070	00:26:05.390	of pedantry up with which I will not put." Some
433	00:26:05.400	00:26:09.610	argue that with so much electronic communication these days, the
434	00:26:09.620	00:26:14.830	telephone, television and everything else, that writing may be becoming
435	00:26:14.840	00:26:17.930	an obsolete skill for the average person to perform or
436	00:26:17.940	00:26:20.290	function in this society. Do you believe that is happening
437	00:26:20.300	00:26:23.240	at all? I wouldn't be running this project if I
438	00:26:23.250	00:26:26.910	felt that. Writing is a way of knowing, and writing
439	00:26:26.920	00:26:28.530	is as close as we can get to teaching students
440	00:26:28.540	00:26:32.100	how to think. We have a potential in the American
441	00:26:32.110	00:26:36.160	school system of almost all students possibly being able to
442	00:26:36.170	00:26:38.970	go on to college. Certainly going on to college you
443	00:26:38.980	00:26:41.550	need to write to be able to survive. The junior
444	00:26:41.560	00:26:45.090	colleges are filled with students who are some of them
445	00:26:45.100	00:26:48.330	dropouts from high school up to 16 years of age.
446	00:26:48.340	00:26:51.310	We've got people coming to college now that we couldn't
447	00:26:51.320	00:26:53.800	predict when they were in the schools. They don't have
448	00:26:53.810	00:26:57.300	to now. To make it in the job world, business
449	00:26:57.310	00:26:59.640	in this country still, I'm sure, is taken care of
450	00:26:59.650	00:27:01.640	with the essay. We are processing more paper than ever
451	00:27:01.650	00:27:05.630	before. We hire people on the Berkeley campus in affirmative
452	00:27:05.640	00:27:08.270	action programs, and they are locked into certain low paying
453	00:27:08.280	00:27:13.690	positions or bottom paying positions unless they can write. The
454	00:27:13.700	00:27:15.420	day will never come as long as we have minds
455	00:27:15.430	00:27:17.330	and as long as we have education that writing will
456	00:27:17.340	00:27:20.510	not be paramount. It hasn't been. I mean it's given
457	00:27:20.520	00:27:23.700	short shrift. For the first time we have an emphasis
458	00:27:23.710	00:27:26.220	on the need for composition in this country. In my
459	00:27:26.230	00:27:29.610	25 years of experience we haven't trained teachers to do
460	00:27:29.620	00:27:32.450	it, and we are just beginning to do it. There's
461	00:27:32.460	00:27:35.870	a crisis. No wonder there is a crisis. We have
462	00:27:35.880	00:27:39.040	never really attacked the problem before. Do you sense at
463	00:27:39.050	00:27:43.060	all, Dr. Scanlon, the need for language among many people,
464	00:27:43.070	00:27:46.510	the need for literary skill, the ability to write clearly,
465	00:27:46.520	00:27:49.730	is actually declining or degenerating, because they can make do
466	00:27:49.740	00:27:52.610	with other modes of communication? Not at all. In fact,
467	00:27:52.620	00:27:56.580	there is increasing evidence that quite the contrary is true.
468	00:27:56.590	00:27:59.790	What we find from the business and professional worlds is
469	00:27:59.800	00:28:03.140	an increasing demand that the people they hire be able
470	00:28:03.150	00:28:06.420	to express themselves clearly and concisely. I do a lot
471	00:28:06.430	00:28:10.550	of teaching of engineers, and the engineer who graduates from
472	00:28:10.560	00:28:13.910	the University of Illinois is likely, in fact, to move
473	00:28:13.920	00:28:16.320	from the field position into a management position in fairly
474	00:28:16.330	00:28:20.410	short order. When he moves, or she moves into a
475	00:28:20.420	00:28:23.710	management position, somewhere between thirty and seventy percent of the
476	00:28:23.720	00:28:25.980	time, and the higher you rise in the structure the
477	00:28:25.990	00:28:28.970	more writing you'll do, so that even in the highly
478	00:28:28.980	00:28:32.450	technical field where sometimes I think we assume the computer
479	00:28:32.460	00:28:37.610	has largely replaced the written word, that we find that
480	00:28:37.620	00:28:39.220	those people who are going to be professionals in that
481	00:28:39.230	00:28:41.240	field are going to have to write. All over the
482	00:28:41.250	00:28:44.550	country, in fact, we see law schools, their great concern
483	00:28:44.560	00:28:47.620	for writing and their students; medical and dental schools, I've
484	00:28:47.630	00:28:50.130	seen some evidence recently which indicates that they have begun
485	00:28:50.140	00:28:53.750	to increase the amount of writing which they expect from
486	00:28:53.760	00:28:56.150	a student when he comes to medical or dental school.
487	00:28:56.160	00:28:59.380	It's almost ten hours. These are new movements and new
488	00:28:59.390	00:29:01.950	directions in the field. I don't have the kind of
489	00:29:01.960	00:29:05.450	experience that Dr. Gray has, but I certainly have been
490	00:29:05.460	00:29:08.130	able to see in the nine or ten years that
491	00:29:08.140	00:29:11.180	I have been involved in composition an increasing awareness of
492	00:29:11.190	00:29:13.590	the importance of the written word and that people be
493	00:29:13.600	00:29:17.580	able to write reasonably well even in technical fields. Yes,
494	00:29:17.590	00:29:19.870	but Dr. Neel, don't you feel--if you can answer
495	00:29:19.880	00:29:24.100	this briefly--that the electronic media of communication are making
496	00:29:24.110	00:29:27.710	it easier to avoid using writing? There's no question about
497	00:29:27.720	00:29:29.140	that now. Now I would agree that people do need
498	00:29:29.150	00:29:31.440	to know how to write, but you've got three English
499	00:29:31.450	00:29:33.090	teachers here, and that's sort of like asking Carter if
500	00:29:33.100	00:29:35.080	the world needs little pills. Of course we're going to
501	00:29:35.090	00:29:36.520	say people need to know how to write. That's what
502	00:29:36.530	00:29:39.520	we do for a living. And I think that the
503	00:29:39.530	00:29:43.070	process of writing is good for people, and it helps
504	00:29:43.080	00:29:45.450	one learn how language is used, and it makes one
505	00:29:45.460	00:29:48.990	not likely to be taken advantage of by a corrupt
506	00:29:49.000	00:29:53.390	politician or the mass media. But nevertheless...I have to
507	00:29:53.400	00:29:55.580	ask you to leave it there. I'm afraid this mass
508	00:29:55.590	00:29:58.130	medium is out of time. Thank you very much in
509	00:29:58.140	00:30:00.340	Washington. Good night, Jim. Thank you here. Jim Lehrer and
510	00:30:00.350	00:30:02.580	I will be back tomorrow evening. I'm Robert MacNeil. Good
511	00:30:02.590	00:31:13.060	night.
