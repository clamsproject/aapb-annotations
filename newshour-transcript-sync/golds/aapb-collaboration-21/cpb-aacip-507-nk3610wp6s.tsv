1	00:01:55.690	00:01:58.700	Good evening. I'm Jim Lehrer. On the NewsHour tonight, the
2	00:01:58.710	00:02:03.800	Bosnia mission, Elizabeth Farnsworth interviews Senator McCain, then come excerpts
3	00:02:03.810	00:02:07.020	from Congressional hearings and a discussion of why it takes
4	00:02:07.030	00:02:10.740	the United States to make and keep peace. New information
5	00:02:10.750	00:02:14.990	on breast cancer. Charlayne Hunter-Gault talks to Dr. Christine Byrd.
6	00:02:15.000	00:02:18.370	And the information highway future, David Gergen has a dialogue
7	00:02:18.380	00:02:21.050	with Bill Gates. It all follows our summary of the
8	00:02:21.060	00:02:51.600	news this Thursday. Senate Republicans began closing ranks today behind
9	00:02:51.610	00:02:55.170	the sending of U.S. troops to Bosnia. Majority Leader Bob
10	00:02:55.180	00:02:58.210	Dole said on the Senate floor he would reluctantly support
11	00:02:58.220	00:03:02.470	the President. I just hope we can all work together
12	00:03:02.480	00:03:06.140	in the coming days to fashion a resolution which supports
13	00:03:06.150	00:03:09.830	our military forces, reduces the risks they face, and brings
14	00:03:09.840	00:03:11.490	them home as soon as possible. Now some would say,
15	00:03:11.500	00:03:13.960	well, if you do this, you're supporting the President of
16	00:03:13.970	00:03:15.890	the United States. I'd say, oh, that's all right with
17	00:03:15.900	00:03:19.030	me. We have one President at a time. He is
18	00:03:19.040	00:03:22.130	the commander in chief. He's made the decision. I don't
19	00:03:22.140	00:03:25.150	agree with it. I think it's a mistake. We had
20	00:03:25.160	00:03:29.490	a better option, many better options. As I said, he
21	00:03:29.500	00:03:34.090	repeatedly rejected those options. Right after this News Summary, we'll
22	00:03:34.100	00:03:37.470	have a Newsmaker interview with Senator John McCain, the Arizona
23	00:03:37.480	00:03:40.810	Republican who spoke with Senator Dole on the Senate floor
24	00:03:40.820	00:03:44.240	today. On the House side today, two key committees heard
25	00:03:44.250	00:03:47.430	the official pitch for sending U.S. troops to Bosnia. It
26	00:03:47.440	00:03:51.790	came from top administration officials, including Secretary of State Christopher,
27	00:03:51.800	00:03:55.860	Defense Secretary Perry, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Shalikashvili. We'll have
28	00:03:55.870	00:03:59.340	excerpts from their testimony, plus more Bosnia coverage following the
29	00:03:59.350	00:04:04.580	McCain Newsmaker. Republican and Democratic budget negotiators cancelled their talks
30	00:04:04.590	00:04:07.650	for the next two days. They said they were deadlocked
31	00:04:07.660	00:04:10.040	in their attempt to agree on a seven-year plan to
32	00:04:10.050	00:04:15.310	balance the budget. Kwame Holman reports. This afternoon, congressional Republicans
33	00:04:15.320	00:04:18.780	unveiled the final version of their seven-year balanced budget, and
34	00:04:18.790	00:04:21.730	sent it to the White House for the President's consideration,
35	00:04:21.740	00:04:24.660	but House Speaker Newt Gingrich acknowledged the reception the plan
36	00:04:24.670	00:04:27.760	is likely to get when the President returns to Washington.
37	00:04:27.770	00:04:30.420	You know, obviously, the odds against his signing this are
38	00:04:30.430	00:04:35.480	pretty steep. Gingrich also complained the White House is not
39	00:04:35.490	00:04:38.770	negotiating in good faith toward a compromise on a seven-year
40	00:04:38.780	00:04:42.650	balanced budget. The White House will not admit how much
41	00:04:42.660	00:04:45.860	more spending they want or how much higher the taxes
42	00:04:45.870	00:04:49.690	are they want compared to our plans. That complaint was
43	00:04:49.700	00:04:53.650	echoed by Republican negotiators late this afternoon, following a two-hour
44	00:04:53.660	00:04:57.430	budget session with the Democrats. We have a right to
45	00:04:57.440	00:05:01.630	know what their budget looks like. They don't want to
46	00:05:01.640	00:05:04.960	tell us. It's very hard to negotiate when you don't
47	00:05:04.970	00:05:08.010	know what you're negotiating. But White House Chief of Staff
48	00:05:08.020	00:05:11.900	Leon Panetta emerged from the meeting blaming the Republicans. We
49	00:05:11.910	00:05:16.410	have constantly said we have got to protect Medicare, we
50	00:05:16.420	00:05:19.970	have got to protect Medicaid, education, the environment. We're not
51	00:05:19.980	00:05:22.720	going to raise taxes on working families. Let's talk through
52	00:05:22.730	00:05:26.610	those issues. We thought that was agreed to. Unfortunately, that's
53	00:05:26.620	00:05:29.590	not what happened today. I hope that after a good
54	00:05:29.600	00:05:32.320	night's sleep that the Republicans will be ready to get
55	00:05:32.330	00:05:34.450	to work and try to see if we can resolve
56	00:05:34.460	00:05:37.650	our differences. The two sides have agreed on one thing,
57	00:05:37.660	00:05:40.140	to take a break from negotiations and not meet again
58	00:05:40.150	00:05:44.740	until Monday. The Senate Whitewater Committee decided today to ask
59	00:05:44.750	00:05:48.540	First Lady Hillary Clinton to answer four questions in writing
60	00:05:48.550	00:05:51.640	under oath. Committee members want to know about a phone
61	00:05:51.650	00:05:54.180	call she might have made the day of the Vincent
62	00:05:54.190	00:05:57.810	Foster suicide. The call was made to a Washington number
63	00:05:57.820	00:06:00.980	from the Little Rock residence where Mrs. Clinton was staying.
64	00:06:00.990	00:06:03.810	Investigators have been unable to determine who was called, or
65	00:06:03.820	00:06:08.900	who did the calling. Four questions as they relate to
66	00:06:08.910	00:06:16.590	the telephone number 202-628-7087 which will be sent to the
67	00:06:16.600	00:06:20.960	White House to Mrs. Clinton to ask if she can
68	00:06:20.970	00:06:24.970	identify the number or the person. Basically, we'll, after we
69	00:06:24.980	00:06:30.970	make some typographical and grammar corrections, we'll have it available.
70	00:06:30.980	00:06:34.530	Pardon. Oh, we have a corrected copy. Well, let's have
71	00:06:34.540	00:06:40.110	it verified and, and we will ask that this interrogatory
72	00:06:40.120	00:06:46.520	be undertaken by Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate we
73	00:06:46.530	00:06:51.790	had the opportunity to consult. This is--it's obviously an
74	00:06:51.800	00:06:57.830	unusual and unprecedented action, to send interrogatories to the First
75	00:06:57.840	00:07:02.200	Lady, and this is an unusual situation, this particular one.
76	00:07:02.210	00:07:05.550	We made every effort to obtain information from the sources,
77	00:07:05.560	00:07:08.360	the telephone company and so forth, and we have not
78	00:07:08.370	00:07:11.770	been able to get full information. So I think the
79	00:07:11.780	00:07:16.980	interrogatories in this instance are appropriate. House Speaker Gingrich attacked
80	00:07:16.990	00:07:20.990	the Federal Election Commission today. He denied an FEC charge
81	00:07:21.000	00:07:25.930	yesterday that a Republican Political Action Committee called GOPAC violated
82	00:07:25.940	00:07:30.240	election laws. The FEC said GOPAC, then headed by Gingrich,
83	00:07:30.250	00:07:36.100	gave $250,000 to his reelection campaign in 1990. Until '91,
84	00:07:36.110	00:07:38.990	GOPAC was limited by law to spending money on state
85	00:07:39.000	00:07:44.290	and local candidates. Gingrich responded to reporters' questions this morning.
86	00:07:44.300	00:07:46.120	Did GOPAC ever contribute to your 1990 campaign? No, it
87	00:07:46.130	00:07:47.970	did not in any way. Not at all? And the
88	00:07:47.980	00:07:51.780	FEC filings are false and malicious. There's an old rule.
89	00:07:51.790	00:07:53.900	If you have the facts, pound the facts. If you
90	00:07:53.910	00:07:55.850	have the law, pound the law. If you don't have
91	00:07:55.860	00:07:58.230	the facts or the law, pound the table. The FEC
92	00:07:58.240	00:08:01.500	is pounding the table. It's a false and malicious charge.
93	00:08:01.510	00:08:04.500	Bill Clinton became the first American President to visit Northern
94	00:08:04.510	00:08:08.060	Ireland today. Hundreds of well-wishers turned out to greet him
95	00:08:08.070	00:08:11.570	and Mrs. Clinton as they arrived in Belfast. They visited
96	00:08:11.580	00:08:15.140	both Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods, shaking hands with people in
97	00:08:15.150	00:08:18.510	the crowd. At the Mackie Engineering plant, the President was
98	00:08:18.520	00:08:23.050	introduced by two children of plant workers. My first daddy
99	00:08:23.060	00:08:25.700	died in the troubles. It was the saddest day of
100	00:08:25.710	00:08:30.500	my life. I still think of him. Now it is
101	00:08:30.510	00:08:33.410	nice and peaceful. I like having peace and quiet for
102	00:08:33.420	00:08:38.050	a change, instead of people shooting and killing. My Christmas
103	00:08:38.060	00:08:40.630	wish is that peace and love will last in Ireland
104	00:08:40.640	00:08:45.300	forever. Please have a safe journey back to America. I
105	00:08:45.310	00:08:49.040	hope you enjoyed your visit to Ireland. And now, ladies
106	00:08:49.050	00:08:52.210	and gentlemen, we would like to introduce the President of
107	00:08:52.220	00:09:04.200	the United States. This is one of those occasions where
108	00:09:04.210	00:09:08.430	I really feel that all that needs to be said
109	00:09:08.440	00:09:14.910	has already been said. For 25 years now, the history
110	00:09:14.920	00:09:17.940	of Northern Ireland has been written in the blood of
111	00:09:17.950	00:09:22.000	its children and their parents. The ceasefire turned the page
112	00:09:22.010	00:09:25.350	on that history. It must not be allowed to turn
113	00:09:25.360	00:09:31.730	back. Later, the Clintons traveled to Londonderry. Thousands were on
114	00:09:31.740	00:09:34.020	hand for the President's speech in the streets of the
115	00:09:34.030	00:09:38.770	300-year-old city. They waved British, Irish, and American flags. President
116	00:09:38.780	00:09:41.570	Clinton told them to work together for peace. The Clintons
117	00:09:41.580	00:09:44.060	returned to Belfast later in the day, where the President
118	00:09:44.070	00:09:46.710	lit a Christmas tree donated by the city of Nashville,
119	00:09:46.720	00:09:50.800	Tennessee. Fifty thousand people attended the ceremony in the square
120	00:09:50.810	00:09:53.480	in front of City Hall. Mr. and Mrs. Clinton will
121	00:09:53.490	00:09:57.840	travel to the Irish capital of Dublin tomorrow. Lumpectomies are
122	00:09:57.850	00:10:01.900	effective in treating early-stage breast cancer. That conclusion from the
123	00:10:01.910	00:10:05.000	National Cancer Institute was published today in the "New England
124	00:10:05.010	00:10:08.380	Journal of Medicine." The report was prompted by questions that
125	00:10:08.390	00:10:13.000	had arisen about the reliability of a 1985 landmark study
126	00:10:13.010	00:10:15.860	of lumpectomies. We'll have more on this story later in
127	00:10:15.870	00:10:19.250	the program. Three days of rain have triggered heavy flooding
128	00:10:19.260	00:10:23.060	in the Pacific Northwest. Every major river in Western Washington
129	00:10:23.070	00:10:27.270	State has flooded, forcing hundreds to evacuate. Gov. Lowry declared
130	00:10:27.280	00:10:30.980	a state of emergency in 14 counties. And in Northwestern
131	00:10:30.990	00:10:35.900	Oregon, mudslides have closed sections of Highway 101 and flood
132	00:10:35.910	00:10:40.530	warnings are issued near four rivers. A volcano in Nicaragua
133	00:10:40.540	00:10:44.780	called Cerro Negro erupted today. It exploded in Leon, northwest
134	00:10:44.790	00:10:48.410	of the capital of Managua. Sand and lava covered fields,
135	00:10:48.420	00:10:52.850	blocked roads, and contaminated wells. No injuries were reported, but
136	00:10:52.860	00:10:56.610	thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes.
137	00:10:56.620	00:10:58.970	And that's it for the News Summary tonight. Now it's
138	00:10:58.980	00:11:03.500	on to Senator McCain, Bosnia hearings, the U.S. as the
139	00:11:03.510	00:11:08.320	world's peacemakers and keepers, new word on breast cancer treatment,
140	00:11:08.330	00:11:21.560	and Gergen and Gates. The Bosnia mission again leads the
141	00:11:21.570	00:11:25.830	program tonight. Our continuing coverage begins with an important development
142	00:11:25.840	00:11:30.330	on the Senate floor today. Elizabeth Farnsworth has that story.
143	00:11:30.340	00:11:33.080	Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole took the floor late this
144	00:11:33.090	00:11:36.760	afternoon along with a bipartisan group of colleagues. They said
145	00:11:36.770	00:11:39.320	they were working on a resolution that would support the
146	00:11:39.330	00:11:43.050	administration's troop deployment in Bosnia and try to define its
147	00:11:43.060	00:11:46.630	limits. One of the Senators joining Dole was Republican John
148	00:11:46.640	00:11:50.520	McCain of Arizona, who had previously raised numerous questions about
149	00:11:50.530	00:11:53.590	the deployment. He joins us now from the Senate. Thank
150	00:11:53.600	00:11:56.030	you for being with us, Senator McCain. Thank you, Elizabeth.
151	00:11:56.040	00:11:59.220	What has led you to move towards supporting the President
152	00:11:59.230	00:12:03.020	in the deployment of troops in Bosnia, albeit with reservations?
153	00:12:03.030	00:12:06.730	Elizabeth, I don't support the deployment of the troops. I've
154	00:12:06.740	00:12:10.060	accepted the fact that the troops are going. There is
155	00:12:10.070	00:12:13.990	nothing the Congress of the United States can do in
156	00:12:14.000	00:12:18.750	reality to stop the deployment. We could pass a block
157	00:12:18.760	00:12:22.950	cutting off funds. The President's veto of that could clearly
158	00:12:22.960	00:12:27.920	be sustained. So we are faced with the situation where
159	00:12:27.930	00:12:31.600	very shortly 20,000 Americans are going to be in Bosnia.
160	00:12:31.610	00:12:35.220	It seems to me that then if that is the
161	00:12:35.230	00:12:38.520	case, and it clearly is, that we should then do
162	00:12:38.530	00:12:42.520	whatever we can to make sure that that deployment is
163	00:12:42.530	00:12:45.940	successful, that they are back in a year, and that
164	00:12:45.950	00:12:48.320	when they leave, there is an opportunity for a lasting
165	00:12:48.330	00:12:50.830	peace, and could I add one more point? Now that
166	00:12:50.840	00:12:54.260	the President of the United States has committed these troops
167	00:12:54.270	00:12:57.710	for us to, if we could, say that isn't going
168	00:12:57.720	00:13:00.770	to happen, then I think it could have negative consequences
169	00:13:00.780	00:13:05.390	on our credibility as a nation, on the NATO alliance,
170	00:13:05.400	00:13:08.530	and, of course, in the view of the three parties
171	00:13:08.540	00:13:11.690	that signed the agreement in Dayton, it could reignite the
172	00:13:11.700	00:13:16.200	conflict in Bosnia. So I guess what I'm saying is
173	00:13:16.210	00:13:18.780	I'm playing the hand that we're dealt. What conditions do
174	00:13:18.790	00:13:20.760	you and your colleagues hope to get in to a
175	00:13:20.770	00:13:25.800	resolution of, of into the authorization resolution? Well, Senator Dole
176	00:13:25.810	00:13:29.100	and I have consulted with people like Jean Kirkpatrick, Richard
177	00:13:29.110	00:13:34.460	Perle, Brent Scowcroft, Paul Wolfowitz, Zbig Brzezinski and others, and
178	00:13:34.470	00:13:39.040	basically what we've sought is fundamentally two things. One is
179	00:13:39.050	00:13:42.190	that our American military will be confined to purely military
180	00:13:42.200	00:13:47.300	mission, this business of resettling refugees or nation building, or
181	00:13:47.310	00:13:50.260	repeating the mistakes we made in places like Somalia that
182	00:13:50.270	00:13:54.450	we just do not believe that that is a reasonable
183	00:13:54.460	00:13:57.140	role, and we want it, their role to be confined
184	00:13:57.150	00:13:59.930	to pure military activities. So second and probably far more
185	00:13:59.940	00:14:03.290	important is that we believe that if there's going to
186	00:14:03.300	00:14:06.070	be a lasting peace or, in the words of one
187	00:14:06.080	00:14:08.720	of our witnesses before the Armed Services Committee, a lasting
188	00:14:08.730	00:14:14.520	ceasefire, that there must be a battlefield of stability and
189	00:14:14.530	00:14:18.290	parity, and as far as the military capabilities of the
190	00:14:18.300	00:14:21.710	Bosnians are concerned. And we want the Bosnians trained, armed,
191	00:14:21.720	00:14:25.670	and equipped, and capable of defending themselves when we leave.
192	00:14:25.680	00:14:28.500	How about a clear exit strategy, is that something you'll
193	00:14:28.510	00:14:32.350	be working on too? Yes, Elizabeth, but the most important
194	00:14:32.360	00:14:36.460	part of the exit strategy would be a stable military
195	00:14:36.470	00:14:40.900	situation in the region, so that fighting wouldn't start right
196	00:14:40.910	00:14:45.070	away. We would envision the United States being there for
197	00:14:45.080	00:14:48.490	a year, everything remaining quiet. If the Bosnians are very
198	00:14:48.500	00:14:52.030	weak, then of course they might fall prey to an
199	00:14:52.040	00:14:55.900	attack by the Serbs or even the Croats at some
200	00:14:55.910	00:14:59.220	point in the not-too-distant future after the United States troops
201	00:14:59.230	00:15:02.970	leave. Senator, you said no non-military activities. As you understand
202	00:15:02.980	00:15:06.840	the annexes to the peace agreement, are there non-military activities
203	00:15:06.850	00:15:09.850	called for? Well, there's a great deal of ambivalence about
204	00:15:09.860	00:15:14.460	that, Elizabeth. The agreement, itself, calls, as you know, for
205	00:15:14.470	00:15:20.750	resettlement of refugees, for elections, for all kinds of civilian
206	00:15:20.760	00:15:24.460	or civil kinds of activities. And we don't object to
207	00:15:24.470	00:15:26.860	any of that, although I think it's very unrealistic, to
208	00:15:26.870	00:15:29.240	be honest. But we don't object to that. We just
209	00:15:29.250	00:15:32.190	don't--we just want to make absolutely sure that American
210	00:15:32.200	00:15:36.260	military personnel are not engaged in those kinds of activities.
211	00:15:36.270	00:15:38.900	In your statement on the Senate floor today, you urged
212	00:15:38.910	00:15:42.650	your Republican colleagues to consider very carefully the institution of
213	00:15:42.660	00:15:45.770	the presidency as they make this decision. Could you elaborate
214	00:15:45.780	00:15:48.830	on that? I absolutely will, Elizabeth, and I think this
215	00:15:48.840	00:15:51.900	is a fundamental and important point. Thomas Jefferson sent the
216	00:15:51.910	00:15:54.500	United States Navy, without the permission of Congress, to wipe
217	00:15:54.510	00:15:59.380	out the Barbary Pirates. President Reagan sent Americans to invade
218	00:15:59.390	00:16:02.980	Grenada. President Bush invaded Panama, et cetera. And as you
219	00:16:02.990	00:16:05.220	know, President Bush made it very clear that if he
220	00:16:05.230	00:16:08.020	did not receive authorization from Congress, he was still going
221	00:16:08.030	00:16:11.140	into the Persian Gulf. He believed he had that constitutional
222	00:16:11.150	00:16:14.270	authority, and by the way, I believe he does too.
223	00:16:14.280	00:16:18.490	So I want us to consider this issue and the
224	00:16:18.500	00:16:22.800	President's authority to commit American troops in a nonpartisan fashion
225	00:16:22.810	00:16:24.980	and to treat it exactly the same as if it
226	00:16:24.990	00:16:28.010	were a Republican President as it is with a Democrat
227	00:16:28.020	00:16:31.150	President. Otherwise, I think in the long run, we could
228	00:16:31.160	00:16:35.340	show disrespect to the very document under which we function.
229	00:16:35.350	00:16:38.430	You also said in your statement that you recognize that
230	00:16:38.440	00:16:41.260	you will bear some of the responsibility in the event
231	00:16:41.270	00:16:43.900	that something goes wrong. Do you think this is important
232	00:16:43.910	00:16:48.250	for our government, that Congress also is bearing the responsibility?
233	00:16:48.260	00:16:50.750	I do. And that's why I think the proposals I've
234	00:16:50.760	00:16:54.290	heard that one of the--maybe the House would just
235	00:16:54.300	00:16:58.940	say we don't vote at all, or a straight vote
236	00:16:58.950	00:17:03.530	of disapproval, which would not be--have to be adhered
237	00:17:03.540	00:17:07.450	to, those things, I think, might make us feel good,
238	00:17:07.460	00:17:10.250	but I do believe that if we accept, as I
239	00:17:10.260	00:17:12.310	said at the beginning of our conversation, that the troops
240	00:17:12.320	00:17:15.940	are going, then it is our obligation to minimize the
241	00:17:15.950	00:17:18.550	loss of life and do whatever we can in our
242	00:17:18.560	00:17:23.100	best judgment to ensure that the mission is most successful.
243	00:17:23.110	00:17:27.700	It seems to me that we abrogate our responsibilities if
244	00:17:27.710	00:17:31.430	we don't actively engage in that effort. Have you spoken
245	00:17:31.440	00:17:35.100	about this with Senator Gramm, whose campaign for the presidency,
246	00:17:35.110	00:17:36.940	you, I think you're the national chairman of it, aren't
247	00:17:36.950	00:17:39.100	you, and who has come out--at least he has
248	00:17:39.110	00:17:42.560	spoken in opposition to the deployment of troops. Absolutely. And
249	00:17:42.570	00:17:45.510	I oppose the deployment as well. I don't think he
250	00:17:45.520	00:17:50.040	agrees with this, this authorization proposal that we're working on,
251	00:17:50.050	00:17:54.090	but Senator Gramm and I have disagreed in the past,
252	00:17:54.100	00:17:57.410	for example, on the issue of normalization of relations with
253	00:17:57.420	00:18:02.250	Vietnam. But we--I'll remain his supporter and I will
254	00:18:02.260	00:18:06.460	remain in close consultation with him on this issue. Senator
255	00:18:06.470	00:18:08.800	McCain, you come to this with a very unique vantage
256	00:18:08.810	00:18:11.530	point, having been a POW in Vietnam for so many
257	00:18:11.540	00:18:14.140	years. I would imagine this has been difficult for you,
258	00:18:14.150	00:18:16.330	thinking this through, and then deciding to do what you're
259	00:18:16.340	00:18:19.580	doing now. Elizabeth, could I say, first of all, I
260	00:18:19.590	00:18:23.670	try to put that behind me and try to do
261	00:18:23.680	00:18:25.310	what I think is in the best interest of the
262	00:18:25.320	00:18:29.660	country. And I'll tell you candidly these phone calls and
263	00:18:29.670	00:18:35.280	sentiment in my state are overwhelmingly against supporting this deployment.
264	00:18:35.290	00:18:38.950	I don't support it, but I do believe that my
265	00:18:38.960	00:18:41.720	obligation is not to take a hike on issues like
266	00:18:41.730	00:18:45.500	these, but it is to try to do what's best.
267	00:18:45.510	00:18:50.030	If one young American dies because we didn't do everything
268	00:18:50.040	00:18:53.600	we could to make this very risky expedition as safe
269	00:18:53.610	00:18:55.980	as possible, then I don't think we have a clear
270	00:18:55.990	00:19:01.150	conscience. And I also feel that we are judged by
271	00:19:01.160	00:19:05.320	history, not by the daily polls. Thank you for being
272	00:19:05.330	00:19:08.600	with us, Senator. Thank you, Elizabeth. Elsewhere on the capital
273	00:19:08.610	00:19:11.680	today, the administration went about the job of selling the
274	00:19:11.690	00:19:16.200	Bosnia mission. Margaret Warner reports on that. Three top Clinton
275	00:19:16.210	00:19:20.030	administration officials came before the House International Affairs Committee today
276	00:19:20.040	00:19:23.470	to outline the proposed U.S. mission in Bosnia. It was
277	00:19:23.480	00:19:26.750	the first time that administration officials had laid out the
278	00:19:26.760	00:19:31.180	specifics of the Bosnia military operation to Congress since President
279	00:19:31.190	00:19:34.940	Clinton announced his intention to have U.S. troops participate in
280	00:19:34.950	00:19:39.860	a NATO peace enforcement operation. Secretary of State Warren Christopher
281	00:19:39.870	00:19:43.730	began by arguing that American ground troops offer the only
282	00:19:43.740	00:19:47.540	viable option for sustaining a peace in Bosnia. We have
283	00:19:47.550	00:19:51.280	a fundamental choice in this situation. As the President made
284	00:19:51.290	00:19:54.520	clear, if the United States does not participate, there will
285	00:19:54.530	00:19:58.400	be no NATO force. And if there's no NATO force,
286	00:19:58.410	00:20:01.190	there will be no peace in Bosnia, and the war
287	00:20:01.200	00:20:05.620	will reignite. We know what would happen. There would be
288	00:20:05.630	00:20:11.050	more massacres, more concentration camps, more hunger, a real threat
289	00:20:11.060	00:20:14.770	of a wider war, and immense danger to our leadership
290	00:20:14.780	00:20:18.330	in NATO, in Europe, and the world as a whole.
291	00:20:18.340	00:20:22.810	Those are the alternatives that we absolutely must avoid. Defense
292	00:20:22.820	00:20:26.970	Secretary William Perry came armed with elaborate charts detailing the
293	00:20:26.980	00:20:31.360	specifics of the operation. The troops would number 32,000, he
294	00:20:31.370	00:20:36.330	said, 20,000 in Bosnia, itself, another 5,000 in Croatia, and
295	00:20:36.340	00:20:40.460	7,000 in neighboring countries. The cost, Perry said, would be
296	00:20:40.470	00:20:47.900	about $2 billion. They start going in about mid-December, assuming
297	00:20:47.910	00:20:50.830	that the peace agreement is signed on the 14th of
298	00:20:50.840	00:20:53.630	December, which is the present plan. They will be going
299	00:20:53.640	00:20:59.330	in a day or so after that. General Shalikashvili can
300	00:20:59.340	00:21:02.430	describe to you in more detail the deployment plan. I
301	00:21:02.440	00:21:06.600	will simply say it will be a rapid deployment. Perry
302	00:21:06.610	00:21:09.770	insisted that all steps were being taken to minimize the
303	00:21:09.780	00:21:12.670	risk to the U.S. forces and to limit the scope
304	00:21:12.680	00:21:17.160	of their mission. We will not repeat the mistakes of
305	00:21:17.170	00:21:21.020	the UN force which is in Bosnia, which allowed itself
306	00:21:21.030	00:21:23.810	to get pushed around, which allowed itself to have its
307	00:21:23.820	00:21:30.230	freedom of movement curtailed. Our troops will be sufficient size,
308	00:21:30.240	00:21:35.570	sufficiently well armed, and sufficiently well trained and with sufficiently
309	00:21:35.580	00:21:38.510	strong rules of engagement that they will be able to
310	00:21:38.520	00:21:43.950	carry out this mission. Still, committee Republicans were skeptical. Gentlemen,
311	00:21:43.960	00:21:49.000	I have here about 140 letters that have come in
312	00:21:49.010	00:21:53.260	since the President's speech opposing the use of ground forces
313	00:21:53.270	00:21:57.960	by my constituents. I have two letters from my constituents
314	00:21:57.970	00:22:02.340	supporting it. What do I tell them when they say
315	00:22:02.350	00:22:04.750	we can't control the peace on our streets in Los
316	00:22:04.760	00:22:10.260	Angeles, New York, Chicago, across this country, with the murders
317	00:22:10.270	00:22:12.670	and killings going on, yet we can go to the
318	00:22:12.680	00:22:15.270	foreign soil and put our young men in harm's way
319	00:22:15.280	00:22:19.210	in a no-win situation? The President has said that we,
320	00:22:19.220	00:22:22.470	unfortunately, can expect casualties. From the studies you do in
321	00:22:22.480	00:22:26.070	the Pentagon on the different scenarios, could you give us
322	00:22:26.080	00:22:29.660	some idea of what kind of casualties we can expect,
323	00:22:29.670	00:22:31.870	because that's the greatest concern we have on this committee
324	00:22:31.880	00:22:35.380	and in the Congress. There are no models for casualty
325	00:22:35.390	00:22:38.050	in this kind of an operation. And anybody that represents
326	00:22:38.060	00:22:41.520	to you that the casualties will be such and such
327	00:22:41.530	00:22:47.230	is misrepresenting, I think, is extending his information farther than
328	00:22:47.240	00:22:49.750	the data will support. I want to ask you very
329	00:22:49.760	00:22:53.650	seriously, Mr. Secretary, because many of us were around at
330	00:22:53.660	00:22:57.600	the time of Vietnam, do you really, really, really, deep
331	00:22:57.610	00:23:00.610	down in your heart, feel this is doable? I don't
332	00:23:00.620	00:23:03.870	want to go through the McNamara experience again, where a
333	00:23:03.880	00:23:06.830	Secretary of Defense comes and says, I knew at the
334	00:23:06.840	00:23:10.830	very beginning it wasn't doable. It's an easy answer, because
335	00:23:10.840	00:23:13.080	it's the same as my official position. Yes, I believe
336	00:23:13.090	00:23:16.280	it's doable. If I did not believe it were doable,
337	00:23:16.290	00:23:18.230	I would not be representing that to you. I would
338	00:23:18.240	00:23:20.370	leave my job before I would come over and tell
339	00:23:20.380	00:23:23.200	the Congress something I didn't believe on an issue this
340	00:23:23.210	00:23:27.400	important. This afternoon, the three Clinton officials went before the
341	00:23:27.410	00:23:31.820	House National Security Committee, the committee with direct oversight over
342	00:23:31.830	00:23:35.670	the military. If the going got tough, committee Republicans wanted
343	00:23:35.680	00:23:39.470	to know, would the President maintain his resolve? And I
344	00:23:39.480	00:23:43.880	haven't seen in this administration the political backbone, if you
345	00:23:43.890	00:23:47.570	will, the moral authority, if you really believe that this
346	00:23:47.580	00:23:52.410	is a mission that has to be accomplished to stand
347	00:23:52.420	00:23:59.270	and continue to, to maintain a force in the face
348	00:23:59.280	00:24:03.370	of overwhelming negative public opinion. One thing I would say
349	00:24:03.380	00:24:05.890	is that this has to be a demonstration that the
350	00:24:05.900	00:24:10.060	President is not unduly motivated by polls, because, if he
351	00:24:10.070	00:24:16.100	were, he would not be recommending the deployment of American
352	00:24:16.110	00:24:20.760	forces. By, by all accounts, this action is, is not
353	00:24:20.770	00:24:24.380	popular, and yet, he's doing it because he believes it's
354	00:24:24.390	00:24:27.900	right. The administration's trio will be back on the Hill
355	00:24:27.910	00:24:32.260	tomorrow before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Still to come
356	00:24:32.270	00:24:35.330	on the NewsHour tonight: Why is the United States the
357	00:24:35.340	00:24:51.120	peacemaker, a breast cancer development, and Gergen talks to Gates.
358	00:24:51.130	00:24:54.280	Now to a central point underlying the U.S. mission to
359	00:24:54.290	00:24:57.030	Bosnia; that there can be no peace agreements like the
360	00:24:57.040	00:25:00.190	one in Bosnia and no peace on the ground without
361	00:25:00.200	00:25:03.630	the direct involvement of the United States of America. We
362	00:25:03.640	00:25:07.120	explore that premise with three men who have written extensively
363	00:25:07.130	00:25:10.310	about the modern, as well as the ancient world: Ronald
364	00:25:10.320	00:25:13.330	Steel, a professor of international relations at the University of
365	00:25:13.340	00:25:17.850	Southern California, author of the Temptations of a Superpower; Donald
366	00:25:17.860	00:25:21.310	Kagan, professor of history at Yale University whose latest book
367	00:25:21.320	00:25:24.710	is on the origins of war; and John Lukacs, author
368	00:25:24.720	00:25:27.970	of many histories of modern Europe, a professor at Chestnut
369	00:25:27.980	00:25:33.050	Hill College in Philadelphia. Ronald Steel, how important a development
370	00:25:33.060	00:25:35.900	is this that only the United States can make and
371	00:25:35.910	00:25:40.560	keep peace in Bosnia? I think it's probably more accurate
372	00:25:40.570	00:25:43.530	to say that only the United States will intervene to
373	00:25:43.540	00:25:45.520	keep peace in Bosnia. If it's just a question of
374	00:25:45.530	00:25:48.740	20,000 men, clearly the Europeans have the capacity to do
375	00:25:48.750	00:25:51.460	that. But they don't have the will to do that.
376	00:25:51.470	00:25:54.840	And I think this is the crucial element that's missing.
377	00:25:54.850	00:25:58.560	They've tried to keep out of direct involvement in civil
378	00:25:58.570	00:26:01.680	war. They've wanted to help the refugees, help civilians, but
379	00:26:01.690	00:26:07.190	to stand aside while the combatants were fighting. They--they
380	00:26:07.200	00:26:08.930	were able to achieve this for a time, but the
381	00:26:08.940	00:26:10.770	war has continued. There's been a lot of pressure in
382	00:26:10.780	00:26:13.520	this country to do something about it to end it,
383	00:26:13.530	00:26:16.060	and now the, I think, the pressure for the United
384	00:26:16.070	00:26:19.640	States to intervene has been building for some time, and
385	00:26:19.650	00:26:24.670	the leadership, if you will, of the United States was,
386	00:26:24.680	00:26:27.380	I think, the crucial factor. The Europeans didn't want to
387	00:26:27.390	00:26:29.320	get locked out of this. They didn't want this to
388	00:26:29.330	00:26:32.170	be an American operation. The Americans did not want--the
389	00:26:32.180	00:26:33.780	American government did not want this to be simply a
390	00:26:33.790	00:26:37.270	European operation. So I see there's--there's two elements there,
391	00:26:37.280	00:26:39.700	I think. There's one that the United States wanted to
392	00:26:39.710	00:26:41.980	end this war, the government wanted to end this war.
393	00:26:41.990	00:26:46.160	I think for humanitarian reasons it's also voiced a security
394	00:26:46.170	00:26:48.340	argument, which I don't think is very compelling. I think
395	00:26:48.350	00:26:51.370	that's very confusing. I think it's muddying the waters here.
396	00:26:51.380	00:26:54.080	It's essentially a humanitarian argument there. And the second one
397	00:26:54.090	00:26:56.300	is that the United States wants to continue to play
398	00:26:56.310	00:27:02.840	a major role in NATO, and the--to make clear
399	00:27:02.850	00:27:04.920	to the Europeans that the United States is going to
400	00:27:04.930	00:27:09.460	remain a European power. Prof. Lukacs, how do you see
401	00:27:09.470	00:27:12.490	this? The question--the word "historic" is one that's thrown
402	00:27:12.500	00:27:15.090	around a lot. Is this a turning point of some
403	00:27:15.100	00:27:18.020	kind that the United States is now in this role
404	00:27:18.030	00:27:21.250	of the maker and the keeper of the peace? It’s
405	00:27:21.260	00:27:25.400	a small turning point. I thought for a long time
406	00:27:25.410	00:27:28.770	that it was a mistake for the United States to
407	00:27:28.780	00:27:32.890	get involved as much in what was the former Yugoslavia,
408	00:27:32.900	00:27:35.770	that the Europeans should have done it. But the Europeans
409	00:27:35.780	00:27:41.510	didn't do that. And now that this agreement or armistice
410	00:27:41.520	00:27:47.950	is cobbled together in Dayton, it's sort of extraordinary and
411	00:27:47.960	00:27:52.920	because of this, I think that given this armistice agreement,
412	00:27:52.930	00:27:56.140	the United States must sustain it. If the United States
413	00:27:56.150	00:28:00.200	now refuses to go along and implement it, it will
414	00:28:00.210	00:28:06.770	be a tremendous loss for American prestige with rather incalculable
415	00:28:06.780	00:28:11.100	consequences. In this respect, I'm very impressed--what I saw
416	00:28:11.110	00:28:14.660	Senator McCain say. I mean, he was very statesmanlike about
417	00:28:14.670	00:28:19.630	this. On the other hand, what is slightly historic about
418	00:28:19.640	00:28:23.400	this, that by and large, the prestige of this country
419	00:28:23.410	00:28:26.790	has been declining for the past few years. The very
420	00:28:26.800	00:28:30.860	fact that the United States now filled a vacuum means,
421	00:28:30.870	00:28:34.080	I hope, more than a temporary rise of the prestige
422	00:28:34.090	00:28:37.750	of this country. Professor Kagan, how do you read this,
423	00:28:37.760	00:28:40.200	this development? Well, I think one thing we need to
424	00:28:40.210	00:28:43.200	understand is what the real character of NATO is and
425	00:28:43.210	00:28:47.110	has been from the beginning. It's--I would describe it
426	00:28:47.120	00:28:49.530	in the way that we ancient historians use to describe
427	00:28:49.540	00:28:53.940	some ancient alliances. An alliance with a hegemon, that is
428	00:28:53.950	00:28:57.590	to say even though everybody is a voluntary member of
429	00:28:57.600	00:29:01.220	this organization, even though there are no formal distinctions among
430	00:29:01.230	00:29:03.830	them, from the first, it was understood that the
431	00:29:03.840	00:29:08.930	United States was the leader of this organization. So the
432	00:29:08.940	00:29:12.510	allies have always looked to the United States for leadership.
433	00:29:12.520	00:29:16.410	There's just no tradition, no history of the rest of
434	00:29:16.420	00:29:20.110	NATO acting independently. I think we have to accept the
435	00:29:20.120	00:29:22.990	fact that that's the kind of alliance that it is.
436	00:29:23.000	00:29:26.390	We shouldn't be surprised that Europeans were unwilling to act
437	00:29:26.400	00:29:30.480	independently but looked to us for leadership. And we need
438	00:29:30.490	00:29:33.640	to fill our part there, not merely because of the
439	00:29:33.650	00:29:37.000	humanitarian issues, which are of course very important, but it's
440	00:29:37.010	00:29:40.530	deeply in our interest to see that NATO continues to
441	00:29:40.540	00:29:44.700	function as a force for preserving peace. But beyond NATO,
442	00:29:44.710	00:29:50.490	Professor Kagan, before NATO--I mean, before Bosnia came Haiti,
443	00:29:50.500	00:29:53.540	came Somalia. All of those were also driven by the
444	00:29:53.550	00:29:58.310	United States. Is this the new world, wherever it is?
445	00:29:58.320	00:30:01.320	Well, I think the great question of where it's necessary
446	00:30:01.330	00:30:03.930	to intervene is always a difficult one, and will never
447	00:30:03.940	00:30:07.130	be able to be determined in advance. That's what we
448	00:30:07.140	00:30:10.610	need statesmen for, to make good judgments about particularities. But
449	00:30:10.620	00:30:13.950	on the larger question, my own opinion is that the
450	00:30:13.960	00:30:16.980	world was presented at the time of the collapse of
451	00:30:16.990	00:30:19.360	the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold War, with
452	00:30:19.370	00:30:22.990	a very rare opportunity for establishing a system that would
453	00:30:23.000	00:30:26.600	preserve peace over a period of time. We find that
454	00:30:26.610	00:30:30.980	there's only one great military superpower in the world, and
455	00:30:30.990	00:30:33.900	it turns out that that power is widely and rightly
456	00:30:33.910	00:30:37.580	understood not to have aggressive designs and not to be
457	00:30:37.590	00:30:41.190	interested in changing things in its own favor but really
458	00:30:41.200	00:30:45.000	having an interest in preserving the situation that exists. In
459	00:30:45.010	00:30:48.140	those circumstances, if that nation is willing to accept its
460	00:30:48.150	00:30:52.300	responsibilities, it can and, along with the people who feel
461	00:30:52.310	00:30:56.180	the same way, of which fortunately there are many, that
462	00:30:56.190	00:31:00.610	violence as a solution of international problems is not legitimate.
463	00:31:00.620	00:31:04.250	And I think Bosnia is about in a deeper way
464	00:31:04.260	00:31:07.450	precisely that point. Do you agree? No, I don't. I
465	00:31:07.460	00:31:11.300	think that first of all NATO is a historic fact,
466	00:31:11.310	00:31:14.350	it's an alliance that was designed to protect Europe from
467	00:31:14.360	00:31:19.390	Russian power during the Cold War. It was an alliance that
468	00:31:19.400	00:31:22.270	is today without an enemy, and what we're living in,
469	00:31:22.280	00:31:24.610	I think, is the kind of after-shadow of NATO, if
470	00:31:24.620	00:31:29.000	you will. We're living with the heritage of European pacivity
471	00:31:29.010	00:31:32.280	and dependency upon the United States, the fact that the
472	00:31:32.290	00:31:35.630	Europeans have not constituted themselves as an independent power in
473	00:31:35.640	00:31:38.790	any way and, therefore, are unable to take a lead
474	00:31:38.800	00:31:40.790	in an issue like this; however, I don't--I think
475	00:31:40.800	00:31:45.650	it's critical for us not to lose the distinction between
476	00:31:45.660	00:31:49.410	tranquility and security. The President has talked about our security
477	00:31:49.420	00:31:51.780	is deeply involved in Europe. Of course, it's involved in
478	00:31:51.790	00:31:56.600	Europe. It's historically been involved in not allowing Europe to
479	00:31:56.610	00:32:00.090	be dominated by a single power which will then be
480	00:32:00.100	00:32:01.990	able to do us great harm. That was why we
481	00:32:02.000	00:32:03.300	were in World War I. That was why we were
482	00:32:03.310	00:32:08.750	in World War II. But it's not about ensuring domestic
483	00:32:08.760	00:32:12.380	tranquility within every European border. This is--So what is
484	00:32:12.390	00:32:14.680	it about this? About NATO, what is NATO? No, no,
485	00:32:14.690	00:32:17.790	no. What is the--what does Bosnia say that the
486	00:32:17.800	00:32:21.000	United States is about? Forget the NATO part, just the
487	00:32:21.010	00:32:23.600	United States. What is it about now? I think the
488	00:32:23.610	00:32:26.860	United States has inherited a role as a leader of
489	00:32:26.870	00:32:32.300	a great alliance and it has become the only powerful
490	00:32:32.310	00:32:35.360	really super powerful country of the world, therefore, there are
491	00:32:35.370	00:32:39.130	tremendous demands made upon the United States by the participants
492	00:32:39.140	00:32:41.690	in this war to do something, by the Europeans to
493	00:32:41.700	00:32:44.460	do something. There's an expectancy to do something. There's also
494	00:32:44.470	00:32:48.250	this feeling among Americans that if we have the power
495	00:32:48.260	00:32:50.480	to do something, we should do something. What we're not
496	00:32:50.490	00:32:53.790	doing in this country is having any kind of debate
497	00:32:53.800	00:32:56.900	about what we ought to be doing, the distinction between
498	00:32:56.910	00:32:59.100	what we can do and what we should do. And
499	00:32:59.110	00:33:02.000	that's why I think that this is a historic moment.
500	00:33:02.010	00:33:04.330	I think that this is the first time that we've
501	00:33:04.340	00:33:06.940	engaged in what is quite likely to be a military
502	00:33:06.950	00:33:11.780	action which is quite divorced from military security. From our
503	00:33:11.790	00:33:14.160	own security? From our own security. Previously we said even
504	00:33:14.170	00:33:18.360	in places like Vietnam, Korea, that these were important for
505	00:33:18.370	00:33:22.050	global balance, Communists would benefit from it if we didn't
506	00:33:22.060	00:33:24.990	help these countries, and that, therefore, our own security was
507	00:33:25.000	00:33:26.850	directly involved because we are in this competition with the
508	00:33:26.860	00:33:31.910	Russians anymore or anybody else anymore. What is the meaning
509	00:33:31.920	00:33:35.980	of alliances? Why should the United States become, in effect,
510	00:33:35.990	00:33:38.340	the global peacekeeper? Now that is the role we can
511	00:33:38.350	00:33:40.550	play, but I think it's one we ought to debate.
512	00:33:40.560	00:33:44.150	Yeah. And that debate--has that debate begun, Professor Lukacs?
513	00:33:44.160	00:33:46.010	Is that what this is really going to lead to?
514	00:33:46.020	00:33:47.430	I mean, is that where we're in the middle of,
515	00:33:47.440	00:33:51.180	actually right now? I don't think so. I think that
516	00:33:51.190	00:33:54.500	the present debate within the country is a very short
517	00:33:54.510	00:33:58.140	range one. I think in the short run this is,
518	00:33:58.150	00:34:01.740	if I may say so, an interesting experiment. It sort
519	00:34:01.750	00:34:04.060	of reverses what's been going on in the past few
520	00:34:04.070	00:34:08.930	years. I hope it works. But allow me to attempt
521	00:34:08.940	00:34:12.270	a--Excuse me, if I can make sure I understand
522	00:34:12.280	00:34:15.820	what you mean, you hope the Bosnia experiment works, is
523	00:34:15.830	00:34:17.870	that what you mean? Yes. If it doesn't work, then
524	00:34:17.880	00:34:20.560	what happens to the long-- the long range is over?
525	00:34:20.570	00:34:23.160	Well, that I don't know, because I'm a historian, not
526	00:34:23.170	00:34:26.620	a prophet. Okay. But--Sorry about that. But I want
527	00:34:26.630	00:34:29.560	to say something to attempt at the risk of being
528	00:34:29.570	00:34:34.310	presumptuous of the longer view, this goes against what is
529	00:34:34.320	00:34:37.570	the long range development. The long range development that these
530	00:34:37.580	00:34:43.140	three big institutions--NATO, the United Nations, and the European
531	00:34:43.150	00:34:47.200	Community--are now 50 years old. They were the result
532	00:34:47.210	00:34:50.590	of the world situation after the Second World War. They
533	00:34:50.600	00:34:54.960	fulfilled a purpose, but they are all to some extent
534	00:34:54.970	00:34:59.480	antiquated, as you know, even NATO, NATO is the North
535	00:34:59.490	00:35:04.410	Atlantic Treaty Organization. What does the North Atlantic have to
536	00:35:04.420	00:35:07.110	do with Bosnia? I mean, of course, this goes back
537	00:35:07.120	00:35:11.440	to 1951, when Mr. Atchison included Greece and Turkey into
538	00:35:11.450	00:35:15.870	NATO, which I think was probably a geographical misnomer. The
539	00:35:15.880	00:35:20.390	United Nations is certainly not united. It's certainly not an
540	00:35:20.400	00:35:26.370	assembly of nations but simply a compendium of governments. The
541	00:35:26.380	00:35:32.030	European Community is not a community. It's an economic organization
542	00:35:32.040	00:35:36.930	with a very, very vague and unknown political future. We
543	00:35:36.940	00:35:40.380	have to think about that. You see, the United States
544	00:35:40.390	00:35:43.850	in a way is now, is an exception, the Bosnian
545	00:35:43.860	00:35:48.000	thing, withdrawing from Europe. We have fewer European bases; we
546	00:35:48.010	00:35:50.380	have fewer troops in Europe than we had five or
547	00:35:50.390	00:35:54.650	ten years ago. The entire movement of the United States,
548	00:35:54.660	00:35:59.360	the composition of the American population is moving westward, away
549	00:35:59.370	00:36:03.070	from Europe. It is a new age that's beginning. That
550	00:36:03.080	00:36:07.380	is the long range development. To some extent, this short
551	00:36:07.390	00:36:11.270	range development of Bosnia goes in the opposite direction. I
552	00:36:11.280	00:36:14.550	welcome it. I hope it works. What's going to happen
553	00:36:14.560	00:36:17.710	in the long run I do not know. Professor Kagan,
554	00:36:17.720	00:36:20.790	what do you see in terms of the United States
555	00:36:20.800	00:36:24.800	long range as a result of what this Bosnia--call
556	00:36:24.810	00:36:28.260	it an experiment--call it whatever you would like? Well,
557	00:36:28.270	00:36:31.120	it depends how it plays out. I see the--It
558	00:36:31.130	00:36:35.210	has to be successful or it will mean--The results
559	00:36:35.220	00:36:37.320	will be very bad news in a long range way,
560	00:36:37.330	00:36:39.280	if it's not successful. I think we have to make
561	00:36:39.290	00:36:43.700	up our minds that this is going to be successful.
562	00:36:43.710	00:36:46.300	The definition of success is going to be argued about,
563	00:36:46.310	00:36:49.480	of course. In my eyes, the critical element is that
564	00:36:49.490	00:36:52.920	we have to show that we are committed not to
565	00:36:52.930	00:36:56.630	allow war to be the way to settle these questions
566	00:36:56.640	00:36:59.850	and that we are prepared to use force to avoid
567	00:36:59.860	00:37:02.640	that in the--in the extreme situation, if we have
568	00:37:02.650	00:37:06.980	to. But I think Mr. Lukacs's observations are interesting and
569	00:37:06.990	00:37:10.110	valuable, and I would just make some distinctions about these
570	00:37:10.120	00:37:14.400	different organizations. The one that seems to me to have
571	00:37:14.410	00:37:18.820	hope and usefulness for the future if it is used
572	00:37:18.830	00:37:24.460	in that way, is NATO. It's perfectly correct and fine
573	00:37:24.470	00:37:26.560	to point out what its origins were and what its
574	00:37:26.570	00:37:31.200	technical orientation is and so on, but it needn't be
575	00:37:31.210	00:37:32.880	only what it was in the past. Of course, it
576	00:37:32.890	00:37:35.460	can't be, since it was chiefly aimed at the Soviet
577	00:37:35.470	00:37:39.200	Union, which doesn't exist. But it's clear that the participants
578	00:37:39.210	00:37:42.590	in NATO are reluctant to just let it fade away.
579	00:37:42.600	00:37:45.490	And they're right to be reluctant. What it presents is
580	00:37:45.500	00:37:49.200	a tool, if properly used, that could be a new
581	00:37:49.210	00:37:52.150	element in international relations, something we haven't seen in the
582	00:37:52.160	00:37:55.480	past that could be used to the general good, and
583	00:37:55.490	00:37:58.310	I think we need to try to make it that.
584	00:37:58.320	00:38:01.890	But, Ronald Steel, whether it's NATO, whether it's UN, any
585	00:38:01.900	00:38:04.970	of these organizations, are they all dependent on the will
586	00:38:04.980	00:38:08.180	of the United States for them to actually perform these
587	00:38:08.190	00:38:10.600	missions? Well, I think NATO and the way that it's
588	00:38:10.610	00:38:13.650	been constructed, it's clearly an alliance that all during the
589	00:38:13.660	00:38:16.070	Cold War has been dominated by the United States. We
590	00:38:16.080	00:38:18.820	were the leader of it, of course, and, therefore, if
591	00:38:18.830	00:38:21.960	NATO is to continue in anything like it's old form,
592	00:38:21.970	00:38:24.880	if the Europeans are continuing to remain rather passive and
593	00:38:24.890	00:38:28.600	concern themselves mostly with enrichment and the United States continues
594	00:38:28.610	00:38:31.340	to want to play this role of global leader, then
595	00:38:31.350	00:38:34.520	I suppose NATO is useful. Certainly one of the, I
596	00:38:34.530	00:38:38.860	think, reasons why the administration has been drawn into involvement
597	00:38:38.870	00:38:41.390	in the Bosnian war after being so reluctant for such
598	00:38:41.400	00:38:44.950	a long time is a concern about making NATO relevant,
599	00:38:44.960	00:38:47.690	of--You don't think it's a concern over making the
600	00:38:47.700	00:38:50.530	United States relevant? Well, but I think they're connected in
601	00:38:50.540	00:38:53.890	the sense that there's the belief that we don't want
602	00:38:53.900	00:38:56.540	the Europeans just left to their own devices; we want
603	00:38:56.550	00:38:58.640	to play a role in Europe, and, therefore, we want
604	00:38:58.650	00:39:00.840	to do something for the Europeans that they're not doing
605	00:39:00.850	00:39:03.130	for themselves. We protected them from the Russians all those
606	00:39:03.140	00:39:06.530	years, which they felt they couldn't do for themselves. When
607	00:39:06.540	00:39:09.240	they worked out a settlement in Bosnia among the contending
608	00:39:09.250	00:39:13.100	forces in 1992, we refused to back it, saying that
609	00:39:13.110	00:39:15.710	it wasn't good enough. People forget that, that there was
610	00:39:15.720	00:39:19.230	a peace agreement similar to the one that was negotiated--
611	00:39:19.240	00:39:21.120	Sure.--in Dayton by the Europeans. But we said, no,
612	00:39:21.130	00:39:24.070	that's ethnic cleansing; we don't like that, we're not going
613	00:39:24.080	00:39:26.850	to--we're not going to support it, but as a
614	00:39:26.860	00:39:29.940	result, the various factions said that they didn't think it
615	00:39:29.950	00:39:31.790	was going to last, and so they continued fighting all
616	00:39:31.800	00:39:35.360	these years. But I do think it's--it's critical for
617	00:39:35.370	00:39:39.760	us not to argue over constitutionality and what should be
618	00:39:39.770	00:39:41.780	the prerogative of the President, all the kinds of things
619	00:39:41.790	00:39:44.340	the Congress is concerned with these days in the name
620	00:39:44.350	00:39:47.750	of credibility. I think there's something very important at stake
621	00:39:47.760	00:39:50.270	here. And this is: Does the United States continue to
622	00:39:50.280	00:39:53.900	define its place in the world the way it did
623	00:39:53.910	00:39:57.160	during the Cold War? I think Professor Kagan states it
624	00:39:57.170	00:39:59.810	very well. I don't agree with him, but should the
625	00:39:59.820	00:40:03.020	United States be, in effect, the international peacekeeper? I'd like
626	00:40:03.030	00:40:05.940	to live in a world where grievances aren't settled by
627	00:40:05.950	00:40:09.020	war anymore either. I don't think we're anywhere near that
628	00:40:09.030	00:40:11.470	kind of world, and I don't think that the United
629	00:40:11.480	00:40:14.260	States has the power to bring about that kind of
630	00:40:14.270	00:40:16.250	world. I think it would bankrupt the United States. I
631	00:40:16.260	00:40:18.930	think it would divide the American people terribly, and it
632	00:40:18.940	00:40:21.610	would bring us all to grief; therefore, we have to
633	00:40:21.620	00:40:25.300	choose our involvements very carefully, and we have to say,
634	00:40:25.310	00:40:28.740	how is this related to the interests and the concerns
635	00:40:28.750	00:40:30.530	of the American people? Now, I think you can make
636	00:40:30.540	00:40:32.780	an argument for intervention in Bosnia, but I think it
637	00:40:32.790	00:40:35.980	has to be essentially on humanitarian grounds. It's not about
638	00:40:35.990	00:40:38.890	stability because Europe has been stable. All right. Could I
639	00:40:38.900	00:40:40.940	say a word about that? One quick word. Yes, sir.
640	00:40:40.950	00:40:46.340	I simply want to say that we mustn't imagine that
641	00:40:46.350	00:40:49.450	if we just back off from Europe and back off
642	00:40:49.460	00:40:51.440	from the rest of the world, everything is going to
643	00:40:51.450	00:40:54.370	be nifty. The assumption is you've got dangers and troubles
644	00:40:54.380	00:40:56.820	if you act, but none if you don't act. We
645	00:40:56.830	00:40:58.750	have made the point that there must be a debate,
646	00:40:58.760	00:41:00.500	and we started it tonight, and it will go on
647	00:41:00.510	00:41:11.330	and on and on. Thank you all three very much.
648	00:41:11.340	00:41:15.650	Now, a breast cancer update. Charlayne Hunter-Gault has that story.
649	00:41:15.660	00:41:20.610	A 1985 study first showed that limited surgery combined with
650	00:41:20.620	00:41:25.220	radiation therapy works just as well as extensive surgery as
651	00:41:25.230	00:41:29.570	a treatment for small breast tumors. The smaller operation is
652	00:41:29.580	00:41:33.360	known as a lumpectomy. Removal of the entire breast is
653	00:41:33.370	00:41:38.090	known as mastectomy. But last year, fraud charges against one
654	00:41:38.100	00:41:42.450	of the researchers raised doubts about the study. Today, the
655	00:41:42.460	00:41:46.220	"New England Journal of Medicine" has published the latest findings,
656	00:41:46.230	00:41:49.340	upholding the study. Here to tell us what it all
657	00:41:49.350	00:41:53.100	means is Dr. Christine Berg, the director of the Breast
658	00:41:53.110	00:41:58.340	Radiation Oncology Section at Georgetown University Medical Center. And Dr.
659	00:41:58.350	00:42:01.630	Berg, tell us about first the original study and its
660	00:42:01.640	00:42:04.980	conclusions and then what led to the controversy. I'd be
661	00:42:04.990	00:42:10.350	very happy to, Charlayne. The study was conceived quite a
662	00:42:10.360	00:42:13.740	number of years ago to look at the best treatment
663	00:42:13.750	00:42:18.580	for the breast for women with early-stage breast cancer. And
664	00:42:18.590	00:42:22.470	the goal was to find out which types of treatments
665	00:42:22.480	00:42:26.100	would be most appropriate. There were three groups of women,
666	00:42:26.110	00:42:29.200	one group treated with mastectomy, the removal of the whole
667	00:42:29.210	00:42:33.810	breast, another treated with lumpectomy alone, and then a third
668	00:42:33.820	00:42:39.230	group treated with lumpectomy with radiation. The study was first
669	00:42:39.240	00:42:45.480	published in 1985, and then updated in 1989, and then
670	00:42:45.490	00:42:50.190	the results at that time indicated that the treatment arms
671	00:42:50.200	00:42:55.990	were identical in terms of long-term survival. All three of
672	00:42:56.000	00:42:59.650	them. All three of them. As, as you mentioned--So
673	00:42:59.660	00:43:03.420	that, in other words, a woman didn't have to go
674	00:43:03.430	00:43:06.650	to the radical step of having her whole breast removed,
675	00:43:06.660	00:43:10.280	but could have the lumpectomy or just, or the lumpectomy
676	00:43:10.290	00:43:15.080	with radiation, the lesser? A woman could opt to have
677	00:43:15.090	00:43:20.780	both lumpectomy with the radiation, or the mastectomy. The lumpectomy
678	00:43:20.790	00:43:25.200	alone arm is showing a higher in-breast recurrence rate, and
679	00:43:25.210	00:43:30.880	so we're advocating treatment either with the lumpectomy with radiation
680	00:43:30.890	00:43:34.720	or the mastectomy. But then a controversy arose because there
681	00:43:34.730	00:43:39.200	were suggestions that the study was tainted, right? Yes. The
682	00:43:39.210	00:43:43.490	controversy arose because the group that did the study, the
683	00:43:43.500	00:43:50.080	National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project, NSABP, noticed that some of
684	00:43:50.090	00:43:56.600	the data from one investigator in Montreal was tainted, and
685	00:43:56.610	00:43:59.330	they found that out of the over three hundred patients
686	00:43:59.340	00:44:03.640	that he had enrolled six of those patients had data
687	00:44:03.650	00:44:07.380	that was not accurate. How bad was it? I mean,
688	00:44:07.390	00:44:11.160	how tainted was it? Well, it--what he had done
689	00:44:11.170	00:44:13.720	was, you know, for like a date of surgery, he
690	00:44:13.730	00:44:16.220	had--in order to ensure that the woman met the
691	00:44:16.230	00:44:19.920	entry criteria, he might have modified the date by a
692	00:44:19.930	00:44:24.490	few days. And so it--you know--it didn't all--
693	00:44:24.500	00:44:27.690	and he knew that he was modifying the date. Modifying
694	00:44:27.700	00:44:30.800	what date? The date that the woman would have originally
695	00:44:30.810	00:44:33.680	had the surgery. Oh, I see. You have to start
696	00:44:33.690	00:44:36.250	the treatment, you know, the radiation with a certain number
697	00:44:36.260	00:44:39.990	of days, you know, to meet the study entry criteria.
698	00:44:40.000	00:44:42.090	And in order to ensure that a woman might be
699	00:44:42.100	00:44:45.080	still eligible, he would push the date of the surgery
700	00:44:45.090	00:44:48.570	up a little bit--And that--Well--And that could
701	00:44:48.580	00:44:54.430	affect the outcome? Well, one would then wonder about is
702	00:44:54.440	00:44:58.630	he accurately reporting all of the information about the women
703	00:44:58.640	00:45:01.370	in terms of their results. Okay. So what does today's
704	00:45:01.380	00:45:07.680	audit show? Today's audit went back and investigated all of
705	00:45:07.690	00:45:12.210	the charts from the major institutions that participated in the
706	00:45:12.220	00:45:15.740	trial. The National Cancer Institute sent out a team of
707	00:45:15.750	00:45:22.200	76 investigators to pull these records, look over all the
708	00:45:22.210	00:45:26.860	important details regarding the dates of treatment, the results of
709	00:45:26.870	00:45:31.160	treatment, to confirm the validity of the information; they went
710	00:45:31.170	00:45:33.890	to the charts individually and pulled those and looked at
711	00:45:33.900	00:45:38.890	them. And they verified that the data that had been
712	00:45:38.900	00:45:43.200	entered into the analysis was accurate. And so now the
713	00:45:43.210	00:45:47.610	conclusion takes us back to the original study. The conclusion--
714	00:45:47.620	00:45:51.360	in parallel with the audit, the "New England Journal of
715	00:45:51.370	00:45:56.530	Medicine" published a--the update, the 12-year update of the
716	00:45:56.540	00:46:04.540	NSABP results, confirming that lumpectomy and radiation when compared directly
717	00:46:04.550	00:46:11.510	to mastectomy is identical in terms of long-term disease-free survival
718	00:46:11.520	00:46:13.860	for women. So in terms of the women out there,
719	00:46:13.870	00:46:16.710	I think the incidence now is about 180,000, is that
720	00:46:16.720	00:46:20.010	right? That's correct, in 1995. What should they be thinking
721	00:46:20.020	00:46:22.540	now, and what would you be telling them? Yes. I
722	00:46:22.550	00:46:25.070	deal with this every day. I mean, I see a
723	00:46:25.080	00:46:27.920	lot of women with breast cancer. I think the most
724	00:46:27.930	00:46:31.740	important thing for them to do is to gather information
725	00:46:31.750	00:46:37.100	about the particulars of their situation, discuss with their physician,
726	00:46:37.110	00:46:40.580	or even better, a group of physicians to find out
727	00:46:40.590	00:46:43.080	what's best for them. All right. Well, Dr. Berg, thank
728	00:46:43.090	00:46:54.830	you for joining us. Thank you very much. Finally tonight,
729	00:46:54.840	00:46:58.540	a Gergen dialogue. David Gergen, editor-at-large of "U.S. News &
730	00:46:58.550	00:47:03.060	World Report," engages Microsoft chairman Bill Gates. Gates has written
731	00:47:03.070	00:47:05.130	The Road Ahead, a book about the future of the
732	00:47:05.140	00:47:10.170	information highway. Mr. Gates, the message of your book is,
733	00:47:10.180	00:47:12.840	or seems to me, is that the next 20 years
734	00:47:12.850	00:47:16.460	will bring more revolutionary changes in the information age than
735	00:47:16.470	00:47:19.570	all of the changes we've seen heretofore. Can you explain
736	00:47:19.580	00:47:23.470	that? The key idea is that the personal computer so
737	00:47:23.480	00:47:27.600	far has just changed the way we create documents. But
738	00:47:27.610	00:47:31.400	as we connect them together, it becomes a revolution in
739	00:47:31.410	00:47:35.880	communications, an ability to find people with common interests, to
740	00:47:35.890	00:47:39.440	explore any subject, to know what's going on. It becomes
741	00:47:39.450	00:47:43.950	an electronic marketplace, where anybody who has consulting services they
742	00:47:43.960	00:47:46.350	want to offer can declare that, and it's easy to
743	00:47:46.360	00:47:50.160	find them and hook up and even do video conferencing
744	00:47:50.170	00:47:52.540	so the work can be delivered that way. So it's
745	00:47:52.550	00:47:56.030	a big step forward in making the world a smaller
746	00:47:56.040	00:48:00.040	place and allowing us to exercise curiosity that we never
747	00:48:00.050	00:48:02.540	could before. Most of the people that talk to you
748	00:48:02.550	00:48:05.740	about your book discuss technological aspects. I'd like to talk
749	00:48:05.750	00:48:07.260	about the other part of it, and that is the
750	00:48:07.270	00:48:12.670	social implications of these changes. You've just recently gotten married,
751	00:48:12.680	00:48:14.310	and I'm really curious, as you think about the possibility
752	00:48:14.320	00:48:17.620	of having kids, do you think we ought to embrace
753	00:48:17.630	00:48:21.260	as a nation the goal that every American child should
754	00:48:21.270	00:48:25.220	be computer literate before graduating from school? I think we
755	00:48:25.230	00:48:27.780	are going to have to make that a clear goal
756	00:48:27.790	00:48:31.940	because people who agree that this is a great tool
757	00:48:31.950	00:48:36.760	should want everyone to have the opportunity that it represents.
758	00:48:36.770	00:48:39.450	Kids start out with a lot of curiosity. They want
759	00:48:39.460	00:48:43.170	to explore subjects, and the classroom environment makes it tough
760	00:48:43.180	00:48:45.920	for things to be individually tailored. If you're a little
761	00:48:45.930	00:48:48.030	bit slower, a little bit faster, you want to learn
762	00:48:48.040	00:48:52.140	it in a different way, the computer can provide that.
763	00:48:52.150	00:48:55.190	The explosion of publishing up on the Internet is a
764	00:48:55.200	00:49:00.510	wonderful thing, and now teachers are taking their multimedia lessons
765	00:49:00.520	00:49:05.180	and contributing them for free to a repository that other
766	00:49:05.190	00:49:08.220	teachers can go in to and get. And students can
767	00:49:08.230	00:49:11.510	go all over the world and find other kids learning
768	00:49:11.520	00:49:15.820	the same thing. So I think it really should be
769	00:49:15.830	00:49:19.080	something that is available in the same way that books
770	00:49:19.090	00:49:24.060	are available to everyone today. The question then becomes, and
771	00:49:24.070	00:49:25.680	you raise this in your book but you don't quite
772	00:49:25.690	00:49:28.300	answer it--I'm curious what you think--how do we
773	00:49:28.310	00:49:30.980	begin closing some of these gaps? I was quite struck,
774	00:49:30.990	00:49:34.700	for example, there was a survey in "USA Today" recently
775	00:49:34.710	00:49:39.100	about computers in homes by racial or ethnic group. Now,
776	00:49:39.110	00:49:42.010	listen to these numbers. In Asian homes, 40 percent of
777	00:49:42.020	00:49:46.650	Asian homes now have computers, 29 percent of white homes,
778	00:49:46.660	00:49:49.270	only 13 percent of Hispanic and 11 percent of black
779	00:49:49.280	00:49:52.190	homes. How do we--how should we go about it?
780	00:49:52.200	00:49:54.490	If every child should be computer literate, how do we
781	00:49:54.500	00:49:58.230	go about closing that kind of gap? Well, I think
782	00:49:58.240	00:50:01.250	there is a big correlation where you have a strong
783	00:50:01.260	00:50:04.600	family structure that puts a high value on education, the
784	00:50:04.610	00:50:10.700	PC tends to move up in their priorities. And those
785	00:50:10.710	00:50:14.020	figures are rather stunning. I think even if you took
786	00:50:14.030	00:50:18.570	out the income effect, you'd still see a potentially growing
787	00:50:18.580	00:50:24.490	problem of, of the opportunity that kids might have there.
788	00:50:24.500	00:50:27.410	Now, there will always be families that can't afford it,
789	00:50:27.420	00:50:30.780	to have it at home, even if they want to,
790	00:50:30.790	00:50:33.690	and so the school and the library are going to
791	00:50:33.700	00:50:37.920	have to be two places where access is available. The
792	00:50:37.930	00:50:41.640	PC is improving quite a bit and it's over the
793	00:50:41.650	00:50:44.960	next five years where I think that the content will
794	00:50:44.970	00:50:47.710	be so much better, the communications networks will be so
795	00:50:47.720	00:50:50.030	much better. The PC will be so much better. That's
796	00:50:50.040	00:50:52.730	the timeframe where we ought to solve this problem of
797	00:50:52.740	00:50:55.610	making it available to everyone. If you go out far
798	00:50:55.620	00:50:58.180	enough, maybe the PC will be cheap enough for most
799	00:50:58.190	00:51:01.340	homes, but I don't think we can wait that long
800	00:51:01.350	00:51:05.710	before we, we provide access. You've, interestingly enough, you're taking
801	00:51:05.720	00:51:08.090	the proceeds from your book and donating them to schools,
802	00:51:08.100	00:51:10.980	to teachers who introduce computers. But you note in your
803	00:51:10.990	00:51:14.840	book that schools have been far slower to introduce computers,
804	00:51:14.850	00:51:18.230	personal computers, than have businesses. In fact, there was a--
805	00:51:18.240	00:51:19.970	there was a piece in the "Wall Street Journal," they
806	00:51:19.980	00:51:22.720	had a big technology section about a week ago which
807	00:51:22.730	00:51:26.100	pointed out that some 60 percent of teachers now have
808	00:51:26.110	00:51:28.030	access to computers but only about 40 percent of them
809	00:51:28.040	00:51:30.690	are incorporating their curriculums. A lot of the teachers don't
810	00:51:30.700	00:51:32.440	seem to know how to use them. They haven't been
811	00:51:32.450	00:51:34.280	trained to know how to use computers, so even though
812	00:51:34.290	00:51:36.020	a city like Detroit can go out and buy a
813	00:51:36.030	00:51:40.190	lot of computers, the teachers, themselves, are not prepared to
814	00:51:40.200	00:51:41.890	teach them in the classrooms. How do we deal with
815	00:51:41.900	00:51:45.290	that? Well, there's a lot to be done. The people
816	00:51:45.300	00:51:48.780	who write textbooks are having to revise those to bring
817	00:51:48.790	00:51:51.830	interactive in to it, and so as the school boards
818	00:51:51.840	00:51:56.170	qualify the next round of textbooks, they'll have to make
819	00:51:56.180	00:51:59.570	that requirement. Training teachers is a big, big deal here.
820	00:51:59.580	00:52:04.000	If your teacher isn't enthusiastic about, embracing it, then there's
821	00:52:04.010	00:52:06.120	no way it's going to get the right use in
822	00:52:06.130	00:52:08.220	the classroom, and then you've got to have not only
823	00:52:08.230	00:52:12.210	the equipment but also the communications connections. And if we're
824	00:52:12.220	00:52:14.840	in balance to providing a few of those and not
825	00:52:14.850	00:52:17.810	the other elements, then it's a waste. One of the
826	00:52:17.820	00:52:20.950	other things that's been true for a while is that
827	00:52:20.960	00:52:24.920	computer usage seems to be more male-oriented than female-oriented. How
828	00:52:24.930	00:52:28.030	do we overcome that gender difference? It's been kind of
829	00:52:28.040	00:52:34.300	a game-oriented motivation which has really pushed towards the boys
830	00:52:34.310	00:52:37.350	who are out there to explore wild things. You just
831	00:52:37.360	00:52:39.820	need to invent more software for girls then, right? Well,
832	00:52:39.830	00:52:42.000	that's going on. A lot of the new software is
833	00:52:42.010	00:52:46.240	very creative, not so much violent games but rather exploration
834	00:52:46.250	00:52:49.680	and things where kids go together and do things. Once
835	00:52:49.690	00:52:52.960	somebody's a user, and they have the confidence that they
836	00:52:52.970	00:52:55.660	can do one thing with a computer, then they branch
837	00:52:55.670	00:52:59.970	out. They find other areas, and it's, it's stunning how
838	00:52:59.980	00:53:03.310	far they go. I've seen this with senior citizens that
839	00:53:03.320	00:53:06.100	start out maybe just with electronic mail or doing their
840	00:53:06.110	00:53:10.500	taxes or playing a game. Then they'll--they'll have the
841	00:53:10.510	00:53:17.180	impetus to go on and be big-time Web surfers. But
842	00:53:17.190	00:53:23.340	that, that first set of learning, people are afraid to
843	00:53:23.350	00:53:26.150	look dumb. They think maybe I'm the person who can't
844	00:53:26.160	00:53:27.730	do it. And so you either have to have a
845	00:53:27.740	00:53:30.660	friend who steps you through it, or you've got to
846	00:53:30.670	00:53:34.040	have an environment where it's other people you can relate
847	00:53:34.050	00:53:37.340	to, or you're all equally nervous about it, and there
848	00:53:37.350	00:53:39.920	is a little bit of learning to go on. There’s
849	00:53:39.930	00:53:44.070	been a debate and literature about whether, you know, getting
850	00:53:44.080	00:53:47.380	too into computers is socially isolating or not. You write
851	00:53:47.390	00:53:50.010	more optimistically that it helps to create social circles and
852	00:53:50.020	00:53:52.470	reach out for more friends. I'm really interested in a
853	00:53:52.480	00:53:57.610	different issue, and that is whether--we found is that
854	00:53:57.620	00:54:00.640	people as they move from city to suburb became less
855	00:54:00.650	00:54:04.560	engaged in civic activities, they became less involved in community-related
856	00:54:04.570	00:54:08.740	activities. How do we overcome the possibility that as people
857	00:54:08.750	00:54:10.960	get hooked into their computers, just as they got hooked
858	00:54:10.970	00:54:14.130	into television, the electronic world becomes so much more important
859	00:54:14.140	00:54:16.240	to them that they'll care much less about what's happening
860	00:54:16.250	00:54:20.960	outside their door? Well, I hope that the computer is
861	00:54:20.970	00:54:24.360	a tool to help you get more involved with what's
862	00:54:24.370	00:54:27.490	going on in your community. I mean, part of the
863	00:54:27.500	00:54:30.360	hallmark of the United States versus other countries is the
864	00:54:30.370	00:54:35.760	civic involvement, the willingness to get involved in charitable activities.
865	00:54:35.770	00:54:40.810	When you're reading about, oh, politics, today those short little
866	00:54:40.820	00:54:44.320	articles that just have the latest scrap, it makes it
867	00:54:44.330	00:54:48.380	very tough to say understand a budget trade-off, you know,
868	00:54:48.390	00:54:50.880	what the vote for or against is, or what is
869	00:54:50.890	00:54:53.600	my representative saying, you know, are they still trying to
870	00:54:53.610	00:54:55.210	make up their mind, are they interested in what I
871	00:54:55.220	00:54:57.650	have to say, what is their voting record on this
872	00:54:57.660	00:55:00.170	issue, and so I think if you have the latest
873	00:55:00.180	00:55:03.190	article there, you can just click to see how the
874	00:55:03.200	00:55:06.810	money is spent, what are those programs. You can then
875	00:55:06.820	00:55:09.460	join a bulletin board group where you get notified on
876	00:55:09.470	00:55:12.460	new things or decide to have a meeting. I think
877	00:55:12.470	00:55:15.510	it makes it much easier to get involved. Government is
878	00:55:15.520	00:55:19.280	so complex, so large that it's pretty daunting to try
879	00:55:19.290	00:55:23.090	and say, I've got the expertise to say some new
880	00:55:23.100	00:55:28.430	law about transportation is a mistake. And I hope that
881	00:55:28.440	00:55:32.580	by politicians putting up their speeches and the bills being
882	00:55:32.590	00:55:36.580	there and different points of view, that people will choose
883	00:55:36.590	00:55:39.660	to get reengaged and find that these are issues that,
884	00:55:39.670	00:55:44.250	that they can understand and make a contribution to. Now,
885	00:55:44.260	00:55:46.190	some people go as far as to say that, you
886	00:55:46.200	00:55:50.810	know, we'll try out direct democracy using electronic devices. If
887	00:55:50.820	00:55:52.700	that would get people more involved, maybe it would be
888	00:55:52.710	00:55:56.690	a good thing. One final question. You may be having
889	00:55:56.700	00:55:58.870	kids in the future. How do you plan to raise
890	00:55:58.880	00:56:00.830	your children--have you thought about it--with regard to
891	00:56:00.840	00:56:02.770	a computer? A lot of time on the computers, would
892	00:56:02.780	00:56:04.470	you limit the amount of time they might spend on
893	00:56:04.480	00:56:05.900	computers as they grow up so that they have some
894	00:56:05.910	00:56:10.890	other outside activities? Using a computer is something we're going
895	00:56:10.900	00:56:14.650	to have to break down into different kinds of activities.
896	00:56:14.660	00:56:16.470	I mean, take reading; you don't want your kids to
897	00:56:16.480	00:56:19.310	read comic books all the time, but if they're reading
898	00:56:19.320	00:56:23.530	great literature, you probably will let 'em spend, spend as
899	00:56:23.540	00:56:26.130	much time as they want. And so we'll have to
900	00:56:26.140	00:56:29.620	have a tool where a parent without being invasive can
901	00:56:29.630	00:56:32.120	get a sense of how is the kid using the
902	00:56:32.130	00:56:36.570	computer and even set a time budget for certain kinds
903	00:56:36.580	00:56:40.600	of activities and, therefore, shape what the kid does. My
904	00:56:40.610	00:56:45.330	parents prevented my sister and I from watching TV when
905	00:56:45.340	00:56:48.040	we were growing up, and I frankly, I'm glad they
906	00:56:48.050	00:56:52.710	did. We ended up reading quite a bit and I
907	00:56:52.720	00:56:56.380	don't think we missed all, all that much. So parental
908	00:56:56.390	00:56:59.540	control over how kids spend their time, I think it's
909	00:56:59.550	00:57:12.930	a worthy trade-off. Thank you. Again, the major stories of
910	00:57:12.940	00:57:16.940	this Thursday, Senate Republicans reluctantly began to support sending U.S.
911	00:57:16.950	00:57:20.420	troops to Bosnia. The Secretaries of State and Defense testified
912	00:57:20.430	00:57:24.500	about the President's Bosnia strategy on Capitol Hill, and deadlocked
913	00:57:24.510	00:57:28.020	budget negotiators cancelled their talks until Monday. We'll see you
914	00:57:28.030	00:57:31.490	tomorrow night with our weekly political analysis, among other things.
915	00:57:31.500	00:58:41.306	I'm Jim Lehrer. Thank you and good night.
