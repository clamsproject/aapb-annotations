1	00:01:39.150	00:01:42.530	Good evening. Here are the top news headlines today. Moscow
2	00:01:42.540	00:01:46.780	threatened to deploy anti-satellite weapons in space. The Farm Credit
3	00:01:46.790	00:01:51.060	Administration, the biggest farm lender, said it needs financial help.
4	00:01:51.070	00:01:55.390	South Africa's currency, the rand, fell sharply. Delta Airlines is
5	00:01:55.400	00:01:58.450	suing the FAA for negligence in the Dallas crash that
6	00:01:58.460	00:02:02.570	killed 135 people. More details of these stories in a
7	00:02:02.580	00:02:05.450	moment. Jim Lehrer is away tonight; Judy Woodruff is in
8	00:02:05.460	00:02:09.360	Washington. Judy? We focus most of the NewsHour tonight on
9	00:02:09.370	00:02:12.780	AIDS, the disease that is fast becoming this country's number
10	00:02:12.790	00:02:16.730	one health concern. A leading AIDS researcher will separate fact
11	00:02:16.740	00:02:20.510	from fiction over just how contagious the disease is and
12	00:02:20.520	00:02:24.000	how it spreads. Next, a debate on whether AIDS victims
13	00:02:24.010	00:02:27.640	should be isolated from society and on whether civil liberties
14	00:02:27.650	00:02:31.160	are being violated by an AIDS blood test. And, finally,
15	00:02:31.170	00:02:34.750	a documentary report on the farm credit crunch, and the
16	00:02:34.760	00:03:05.410	prospects for a multibillion dollar bailout by taxpayers. Moscow said
17	00:03:05.420	00:03:09.340	today it will feel free to deploy anti-satellite weapons in
18	00:03:09.350	00:03:12.200	space if the U.S. goes ahead with the planned test
19	00:03:12.210	00:03:15.990	of an anti-satellite rocket. President Reagan authorized such a test
20	00:03:16.000	00:03:18.920	last month, saying it was needed to match Soviet development
21	00:03:18.930	00:03:22.070	of similar weapons. The Pentagon said today the Air Force
22	00:03:22.080	00:03:25.320	would go ahead with the test later this month. Two
23	00:03:25.330	00:03:30.190	years ago, then-Soviet leader Yuri Andropov announced a unilateral moratorium
24	00:03:30.200	00:03:33.900	on the testing and deployment of anti-satellite weapons. Today the
25	00:03:33.910	00:03:36.760	Soviet news agency Tass said that if the U.S. held
26	00:03:36.770	00:03:41.480	tests, Moscow would consider itself free of the unilateral commitment.
27	00:03:41.490	00:03:44.470	Tass said the United States' decision was "An action leading
28	00:03:44.480	00:03:47.170	directly to the start of a new class of dangerous
29	00:03:47.180	00:03:52.550	armaments--strike space weapons." Judy? Officials of the nation's largest
30	00:03:52.560	00:03:55.620	farm lending system say that it will collapse unless it
31	00:03:55.630	00:03:58.970	gets a huge infusion of federal money. In a dramatic
32	00:03:58.980	00:04:02.460	turnaround from his statements over the past few months, Donald
33	00:04:02.470	00:04:06.050	Wilkinson, the head of the Farm Credit Administration, told the
34	00:04:06.060	00:04:09.350	Wall Street Journal the system can no longer absorb its
35	00:04:09.360	00:04:12.920	losses and is in immediate need of a federal bailout.
36	00:04:12.930	00:04:17.220	The system has out some $74 billion in loans, eleven
37	00:04:17.230	00:04:20.200	billion of which are said to be uncollectable. At a
38	00:04:20.210	00:04:24.050	news conference today, Agriculture Secretary John Block said that he
39	00:04:24.060	00:04:27.760	was not surprised by Wilkinson's comments, but gave no hint
40	00:04:27.770	00:04:31.180	of what, if anything, the Reagan administration is prepared to
41	00:04:31.190	00:04:36.430	do. We don't have the options all laid out, and
42	00:04:36.440	00:04:38.440	we're certainly not prepared to lay them out for the
43	00:04:38.450	00:04:41.180	public at this point in time. And, frankly, I don't
44	00:04:41.190	00:04:43.590	even think the Farm Credit System has all the options
45	00:04:43.600	00:04:47.830	laid out. So right now we're monitoring it on a
46	00:04:47.840	00:04:52.020	daily basis. We watch with interest and we listen to
47	00:04:52.030	00:04:56.720	and talk to the governor of the system, but it
48	00:04:56.730	00:05:00.870	is vitally important any system that provides more than a
49	00:05:00.880	00:05:06.250	third of the credit to American agriculture, seventy-some billion dollars,
50	00:05:06.260	00:05:10.570	it's vitally important that that system not only survive--because
51	00:05:10.580	00:05:14.620	survival, of course, is important--but I want farmers to
52	00:05:14.630	00:05:20.530	survive too, and farmers can't survive with 16% interest. They
53	00:05:20.540	00:05:24.650	need to have competitive interest rates. Secretary Block said the
54	00:05:24.660	00:05:27.780	farm credit crisis has been discussed at three or four
55	00:05:27.790	00:05:30.840	Cabinet meetings, but indicated it's too early to know what
56	00:05:30.850	00:05:34.570	action may be taken. House Speaker Tip O'Neill said today
57	00:05:34.580	00:05:39.010	that President Reagan "doesn't give a damn about trade problems,"
58	00:05:39.020	00:05:42.630	that O'Neill said are costing the nation thousands of jobs.
59	00:05:42.640	00:05:46.480	Speaking at a swearing-in for a newly-elected congressman from Texas,
60	00:05:46.490	00:05:50.810	O'Neill blasted several of Mr. Reagan's policies and said popular
61	00:05:50.820	00:05:54.700	support for him isn't what it seems. He's high on
62	00:05:54.710	00:05:58.610	the polls. He's still high on the polls personally, as
63	00:05:58.620	00:06:02.090	a fellow that they like him for his leadership ability.
64	00:06:02.100	00:06:04.280	But I am seeing a sentiment there that I haven't
65	00:06:04.290	00:06:10.000	seen before, an anti-Reagan policy sentiment is developing across America,
66	00:06:10.010	00:06:13.200	from big business who are fighting the tax bill, who
67	00:06:13.210	00:06:16.870	don't like his tax equalization bill, to the trade bills
68	00:06:16.880	00:06:20.690	that they see out there. And to express the views
69	00:06:20.700	00:06:24.050	of many people as far as trade is concerned, I
70	00:06:24.060	00:06:27.470	keep hearing the fact that America is losing 3,500 jobs
71	00:06:27.480	00:06:31.300	a day. And after the incident of his refusing to
72	00:06:31.310	00:06:33.950	go along with the commission on shoes, they're saying the
73	00:06:33.960	00:06:38.360	President doesn't give a damn. School reopened for millions of
74	00:06:38.370	00:06:41.390	children across the country, but not in parts of six
75	00:06:41.400	00:06:45.320	states where teachers were on strike: Illinois, Rhode Island, Michigan,
76	00:06:45.330	00:06:49.760	Pennsylvania, Ohio and Washington. The largest number of children affected,
77	00:06:49.770	00:06:54.340	430,000, was in Chicago, where late today the teachers tentatively
78	00:06:54.350	00:06:58.240	agreed to a settlement on their dispute over wages. Delta
79	00:06:58.250	00:07:02.170	Airlines disclosed today that it is accusing air traffic controllers
80	00:07:02.180	00:07:06.180	of negligence in a crash that took 135 lives. The
81	00:07:06.190	00:07:10.310	Delta Lockheed 1011 crashed on August 2nd while approaching Dallas-Ft.
82	00:07:10.320	00:07:13.960	Worth airport during a severe thunderstorm. In the suit, filed
83	00:07:13.970	00:07:17.160	in federal court in Dallas, Delta said the controllers were
84	00:07:17.170	00:07:21.090	responsible and the Federal Aviation Administration should pay part of
85	00:07:21.100	00:07:24.950	any damages that might be assessed against the airline. In
86	00:07:24.960	00:07:27.280	another suit, the family of one of the victims says
87	00:07:27.290	00:07:30.460	the Delta crew slowed the aircraft down too much to
88	00:07:30.470	00:07:34.680	maintain control. Conceivably, Delta is now blaming that on the
89	00:07:34.690	00:07:37.610	air controllers, but the court papers do not say that
90	00:07:37.620	00:07:42.020	specifically. The Food and Drug Administration today made it possible
91	00:07:42.030	00:07:45.270	for the tranquilizer Valium to be marketed at a cheaper
92	00:07:45.280	00:07:50.230	price and under its generic name, diazepam. The FDA gave three
93	00:07:50.240	00:07:54.460	companies the right to market Valium, ending a 22-year monopoly
94	00:07:54.470	00:07:58.650	by the Hoffman-LaRoche Corporation, whose patent on the drug expired
95	00:07:58.660	00:08:01.750	earlier this year. At a news conference today to announce
96	00:08:01.760	00:08:05.690	the move, Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler said
97	00:08:05.700	00:08:08.880	this means that nine of the ten top-selling drugs in
98	00:08:08.890	00:08:13.710	the U.S. are now available in generic versions. In California
99	00:08:13.720	00:08:17.080	today, Rita Lavelle, the former head of the Reagan administration's
100	00:08:17.090	00:08:22.140	Environmental Protection Agency Toxic Waste Superfund, was freed from the
101	00:08:22.150	00:08:26.680	federal prison at Pleasanton. Ms. Lavelle called her six-month sentence
102	00:08:26.690	00:08:30.610	for lying to Congress "an awful experience." She also claimed
103	00:08:30.620	00:08:33.100	she was innocent and declared that she would try to
104	00:08:33.110	00:08:36.050	prove that. At this point in my life I'm forced
105	00:08:36.060	00:08:40.280	to admit that if certain politicians want to destroy and
106	00:08:40.290	00:08:46.010	discredit you, they can and will use any means, and
107	00:08:46.020	00:08:50.620	seemingly can achieve any end. In spite of all that's
108	00:08:50.630	00:08:56.100	happened, I'm still a loyal American, a proud patriot; however,
109	00:08:56.110	00:08:59.710	love carries with it responsibilities to point out wrongs and
110	00:08:59.720	00:09:04.300	weaknesses, to make corrections, to ensure that our republic is
111	00:09:04.310	00:09:09.630	the best possible democracy. My attorneys, the Bierbauers, have filed
112	00:09:09.640	00:09:13.370	an appeal with the Supreme Court. The appeal raises a
113	00:09:13.380	00:09:17.260	number of important questions, not only for Rita Lavelle, but
114	00:09:17.270	00:09:22.360	also for all American citizens. South Africa's currency came under
115	00:09:22.370	00:09:26.380	new pressure today. The rand fell 11% against the U.S.
116	00:09:26.390	00:09:30.310	dollar, but recovered after intervention by the central bank. In
117	00:09:30.320	00:09:33.180	New York the bank's governor, Gehrard de Kock, said South
118	00:09:33.190	00:09:35.960	Africa might have to pledge its gold reserves to meet
119	00:09:35.970	00:09:38.800	the debt crisis. He told a press conference that the
120	00:09:38.810	00:09:42.080	crisis was caused by just two or three U.S. banks
121	00:09:42.090	00:09:46.050	refusing to renew maturing loans. To meet the situation South
122	00:09:46.060	00:09:49.520	Africa has frozen debt repayment for four months until it
123	00:09:49.530	00:09:53.230	can reschedule the debts. In South Africa there was further
124	00:09:53.240	00:09:57.080	rioting overnight and again today. Three people were killed and
125	00:09:57.090	00:10:01.700	at least 40 wounded. At least 14 people were killed
126	00:10:01.710	00:10:04.950	and 46 wounded today when a car bomb exploded in
127	00:10:04.960	00:10:08.490	a Christian community in eastern Lebanon. The blast came in
128	00:10:08.500	00:10:12.880	Zahle, the only major Christian center in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa
129	00:10:12.890	00:10:15.560	Valley, and officials said they did not know who was
130	00:10:15.570	00:10:20.680	responsible. And, in Beirut, fighting between Shiite and Palestinian soldiers
131	00:10:20.690	00:10:24.770	around a refugee camp left five people dead, including two
132	00:10:24.780	00:10:30.400	Shiite children. In Egypt tonight, a surprise cabinet resignation. Prime
133	00:10:30.410	00:10:35.240	Minister Kamal Hassan Ali resigned without giving a reason. President
134	00:10:35.250	00:10:39.300	Hosni Mubarak named Dr. Ali Lotfi as his replacement and
135	00:10:39.310	00:10:42.800	asked him to form a new cabinet. Lotfi was Egypt's
136	00:10:42.810	00:10:46.230	finance minister under the late President Anwar Sadat. One of
137	00:10:46.240	00:10:49.950	the major problems facing the Mubarak government is Egypt's huge
138	00:10:49.960	00:10:55.820	foreign debt, now in the $25-billion range. That concludes our
139	00:10:55.830	00:10:58.900	news summary. Coming up, a major focus section on fear
140	00:10:58.910	00:11:03.030	of AIDS. Should victims be isolated? Should people known to
141	00:11:03.040	00:11:07.220	have AIDS exposure be tracked? Then, a documentary update: the
142	00:11:07.230	00:11:10.570	mounting crisis in the agency most farmers borrow from, the
143	00:11:10.580	00:11:25.050	Farm Credit Administration. We devote the major part of our
144	00:11:25.060	00:11:28.090	program tonight to a look at the mounting public concern
145	00:11:28.100	00:11:31.730	over AIDS, a disease that has already afflicted just under
146	00:11:31.740	00:11:39.010	13,000 people and claimed 6,481 lives. With no cure, treatment
147	00:11:39.020	00:11:43.250	or preventive vaccine in sight, some citizens are taking drastic
148	00:11:43.260	00:11:48.100	steps to protect themselves against infection. Correspondent June Cross has
149	00:11:48.110	00:11:52.090	this background report. All most people know about AIDS is
150	00:11:52.100	00:11:55.310	that it kills and now, as the disease spreads, the
151	00:11:55.320	00:11:58.510	fear of catching it is spreading even faster. Here in
152	00:11:58.520	00:12:01.460	New York City, which accounts for one-third of all AIDS
153	00:12:01.470	00:12:05.240	cases, healthy citizens are beginning to react angrily to the
154	00:12:05.250	00:12:09.790	idea of having AIDS patients living in their midst. These
155	00:12:09.800	00:12:12.760	people try and tell me it's not contagious, and I
156	00:12:12.770	00:12:15.000	know it's different or else why would a nurse or
157	00:12:15.010	00:12:18.270	a doctor put a mask on when they go into
158	00:12:18.280	00:12:21.180	their rooms to take care of them? This man didn't
159	00:12:21.190	00:12:23.950	like the news that the city planned to place ten
160	00:12:23.960	00:12:27.180	AIDS patients in the nursing home where he lives, and
161	00:12:27.190	00:12:30.200	he was not the only one upset. The residents in
162	00:12:30.210	00:12:34.560	this Queens, New York Community successfully blocked the city's action.
163	00:12:34.570	00:12:38.440	These people, they are sick people, and they belong in
164	00:12:38.450	00:12:41.230	city hospitals. They don't belong in a home for the
165	00:12:41.240	00:12:45.090	elderly. It's not just adult AIDS patients who are raising
166	00:12:45.100	00:12:49.070	concerns. Parents are worried that their children might contract the
167	00:12:49.080	00:12:52.210	disease from playmates who have it. Last week, a school
168	00:12:52.220	00:12:54.580	board in the Queens area of New York said it
169	00:12:54.590	00:12:58.270	would prohibit children with AIDS from attending school. The mayor
170	00:12:58.280	00:13:01.890	of New York, conceding that schoolchildren could pose a risk,
171	00:13:01.900	00:13:06.080	on Friday announced a new city policy. Before a child
172	00:13:06.090	00:13:12.550	with AIDS would be permitted to enter the regular classroom,
173	00:13:12.560	00:13:15.580	that child will be examined to determine whether that is
174	00:13:15.590	00:13:20.160	appropriate for the child, whether that's appropriate for the child's
175	00:13:20.170	00:13:24.480	classmates. Fear of the disease and a desire to isolate
176	00:13:24.490	00:13:28.260	its victims is not just a New York City phenomenon.
177	00:13:28.270	00:13:32.520	Seventh-grader Ryan White of Kokomo, Indiana, is a hemophiliac. Last
178	00:13:32.530	00:13:36.250	December he got the AIDS diagnosis. Now he has to
179	00:13:36.260	00:13:39.430	attend school from the other side of a telephone. Ryan,
180	00:13:39.440	00:13:43.660	do you find that in your book? Yeah. His family
181	00:13:43.670	00:13:45.870	is suing the local school system to get him back
182	00:13:45.880	00:13:50.950	in the classroom. That case is still pending. AIDS patients
183	00:13:50.960	00:13:53.570	are not only being kept out of the classrooms; they're
184	00:13:53.580	00:13:57.080	being fired from their jobs. Gar Traynor used to work
185	00:13:57.090	00:14:00.020	as a flight attendant with United Air Lines. A San
186	00:14:00.030	00:14:03.810	Francisco resident, he was diagnosed as having AIDS two years
187	00:14:03.820	00:14:08.950	ago. A week after my diagnosis, I informed United, and
188	00:14:08.960	00:14:11.490	if I was going to be taking chemotherapy for the
189	00:14:11.500	00:14:16.000	cancer it may involve some schedule conflicts. That was fine,
190	00:14:16.010	00:14:20.080	there was no problem until six months later I was
191	00:14:20.090	00:14:23.110	called into the office at eight o'clock in the morning
192	00:14:23.120	00:14:26.260	by one of the supervisors and told, effective immediately, that
193	00:14:26.270	00:14:28.820	I was on a medical leave of absence. And this
194	00:14:28.830	00:14:32.030	was their choice, not mine. In a letter to Traynor,
195	00:14:32.040	00:14:36.160	United officials stated, "The exact method of transmission is in
196	00:14:36.170	00:14:39.150	fact not only controversial but at this point in time
197	00:14:39.160	00:14:42.020	conjectural. Since the bulk of the duties as a flight
198	00:14:42.030	00:14:45.390	attendant involve food and beverage handling, it was felt that
199	00:14:45.400	00:14:48.290	in the interests of United's flying public that you not
200	00:14:48.300	00:14:52.480	perform those duties as a flight attendant." Traynor filed suit,
201	00:14:52.490	00:14:55.990	and the matter was solved through arbitration. He was reinstated
202	00:14:56.000	00:14:59.870	with $24,000 in back pay, but in the meantime his
203	00:14:59.880	00:15:04.310	deteriorating health has kept him from resuming his work. Whether
204	00:15:04.320	00:15:08.050	the patient is an innocent schoolboy or a homosexual man,
205	00:15:08.060	00:15:10.870	the AIDS diagnosis is a kind of scarlet letter that
206	00:15:10.880	00:15:14.710	shuts them off from human company. Robert, 32, is an
207	00:15:14.720	00:15:18.310	arts professional in Seattle, Washington, who was diagnosed with the
208	00:15:18.320	00:15:21.620	disease seven months ago. When you get AIDS you're already
209	00:15:21.630	00:15:24.670	in a weakened condition, you know? I mean, your entire
210	00:15:24.680	00:15:34.350	system is weakened, and to have this--I mean, I
211	00:15:34.360	00:15:37.110	hate to use the term, sort of witch hunt kind
212	00:15:37.120	00:15:46.710	of attitude on it, it's so inhumane I can't believe
213	00:15:46.720	00:15:51.340	it. Anti-AIDS fervor in Washington State has grown so strong
214	00:15:51.350	00:15:54.150	that one group in Tacoma is calling for all AIDS
215	00:15:54.160	00:15:58.890	patients to be quarantined. We're not talking about discriminating against
216	00:15:58.900	00:16:05.430	gays. We are talking about discriminating against someone with an
217	00:16:05.440	00:16:10.100	infectious disease. We discriminated against lepers. There is a leprosarium
218	00:16:10.110	00:16:16.180	in Carville, Louisiana. Until they are no longer shedding mycobacterium
219	00:16:16.190	00:16:19.840	leprae, they are there. The Christian fellowship group that Dr.
220	00:16:19.850	00:16:23.090	Newman belongs to not only wants to isolate victims but
221	00:16:23.100	00:16:26.640	to publish their names in the newspaper. And I don't
222	00:16:26.650	00:16:29.900	care whether he's homosexual or heterosexual or whatever he is--
223	00:16:29.910	00:16:32.960	As soon as he's diagnosed? Yes. This should be made
224	00:16:32.970	00:16:41.470	public knowledge. Yeah, that's really charming. You know, that was
225	00:16:41.480	00:16:43.130	one of the things that I realized when I heard
226	00:16:43.140	00:16:52.050	the diagnosis was the--I would not have wanted to
227	00:16:52.060	00:16:57.360	have the job of telling people what was going on
228	00:16:57.370	00:17:02.040	with me taken away from me. It's akin to, say,
229	00:17:02.050	00:17:05.230	some dog having rabies, okay. This is something that we
230	00:17:05.240	00:17:08.210	can die from. This is not anything that you can
231	00:17:08.220	00:17:09.850	go to the doctor and you can be cured for
232	00:17:09.860	00:17:12.890	it. If it was, you know, then we wouldn't have
233	00:17:12.900	00:17:17.960	this problem. But, see, what we have to have is
234	00:17:17.970	00:17:22.890	these individuals that have AIDS, okay, they're going to have
235	00:17:22.900	00:17:25.660	to face the fact that it's like they're carrying around
236	00:17:25.670	00:17:30.930	a gun. AIDS patients like Robert are increasingly feeling quarantined,
237	00:17:30.940	00:17:34.640	even without any formal laws dictating it. To protect those
238	00:17:34.650	00:17:37.870	like him, the city of Los Angeles last month passed
239	00:17:37.880	00:17:41.930	the nation's first ordinance aimed at prohibiting discrimination against AIDS
240	00:17:41.940	00:17:46.540	sufferers. But, given growing public opinion against them, AIDS patients
241	00:17:46.550	00:17:51.230	doubt they'll stop being victims any time soon. Here now
242	00:17:51.240	00:17:53.780	to tell us just what is known about how AIDS
243	00:17:53.790	00:17:58.000	is spread is Mathilde Krim, a leading AIDS researcher and
244	00:17:58.010	00:18:01.800	head of the AIDS Medical Foundation. Dr. Krim, we know
245	00:18:01.810	00:18:06.870	AIDS is contagious. Just how is it spread? AIDS is
246	00:18:06.880	00:18:13.840	contagious strictly through the transmission of a virus, which passes
247	00:18:13.850	00:18:18.250	from one person to another during sexual intercourse or with
248	00:18:18.260	00:18:23.630	contaminated blood. It is not contagious at all through casual
249	00:18:23.640	00:18:29.740	interaction with people in normal social conditions such as living
250	00:18:29.750	00:18:34.140	in a household with a patient or meeting patients on
251	00:18:34.150	00:18:37.650	the bus or on the working place or in school.
252	00:18:37.660	00:18:40.160	But now, what about these reports that we've seen recently
253	00:18:40.170	00:18:43.240	that the AIDS virus has been found in teardrops and
254	00:18:43.250	00:18:47.870	in saliva? Yes, the AIDS virus has been found in
255	00:18:47.880	00:18:51.390	such body fluids, but it is not transmitted through them.
256	00:18:51.400	00:18:54.990	The only body fluids that have been found capable of
257	00:18:55.000	00:18:58.260	transmitting the AIDS virus have been blood and semen so
258	00:18:58.270	00:19:03.310	far. So you can absolutely rule out any other form
259	00:19:03.320	00:19:08.880	of contact or contagion other than the blood or sexual
260	00:19:08.890	00:19:13.320	contact, is that right? People like me in research or
261	00:19:13.330	00:19:17.160	in medicine base their opinion on facts. The facts we
262	00:19:17.170	00:19:20.030	know are those I mentioned. We don't know of any
263	00:19:20.040	00:19:22.370	other facts. So for the time being I can say
264	00:19:22.380	00:19:26.990	categorically that AIDS is not transmitted through casual contact or
265	00:19:27.000	00:19:31.660	through other body fluids, but sexual secretions or blood. All
266	00:19:31.670	00:19:33.290	right, let me ask you this. We hear over and
267	00:19:33.300	00:19:36.840	over that it's homosexuals who are at the highest risk,
268	00:19:36.850	00:19:40.830	and yet we've also read that in Africa men and
269	00:19:40.840	00:19:46.480	women have AIDS, apparently in almost equal numbers. Can you
270	00:19:46.490	00:19:50.520	shed light on that? Well, this is a very puzzling
271	00:19:50.530	00:19:53.840	situation in this country and in Europe. You are right.
272	00:19:53.850	00:19:58.640	In Africa AIDS is a venereal disease which attacks men
273	00:19:58.650	00:20:02.050	and women in equal numbers. In this country it has
274	00:20:02.060	00:20:06.660	been reported first in the gay community, and a little
275	00:20:06.670	00:20:09.780	later on among I.V. drug users and now, as we
276	00:20:09.790	00:20:14.360	heard, among other people, recipients of blood transfusions, certain children
277	00:20:14.370	00:20:17.970	born of women infected with the virus that makes people
278	00:20:17.980	00:20:24.020	susceptible to AIDS, and among a few people in the
279	00:20:24.030	00:20:28.280	general population who don't belong to any of these at-risk
280	00:20:28.290	00:20:31.490	groups. The only conclusion we can come at is--the
281	00:20:31.500	00:20:34.510	conclusion I came to is that the AIDS virus must
282	00:20:34.520	00:20:38.380	have been brought into this country either by a person
283	00:20:38.390	00:20:44.790	infected or blood that was infected and given, transmitted to
284	00:20:44.800	00:20:51.330	a gay man. Now, the gay male community is closed
285	00:20:51.340	00:20:55.210	from the standpoint of sexual interactions. Gay men have sex
286	00:20:55.220	00:20:58.430	with each other. And therefore the virus spread among them;
287	00:20:58.440	00:21:01.710	they became infected first. This must have been in the
288	00:21:01.720	00:21:05.710	late '70s, the early '80s, and they became the first
289	00:21:05.720	00:21:11.770	victims with clinical symptoms of AIDS. Since then, since about
290	00:21:11.780	00:21:14.710	a few months ago, we have had a blood test
291	00:21:14.720	00:21:19.190	which can track the spread of the virus infection in
292	00:21:19.200	00:21:23.140	the population. Several groups, different groups of people, have been
293	00:21:23.150	00:21:25.820	studied in this way, and we know now that the
294	00:21:25.830	00:21:29.310	virus is present at a low level, but present in
295	00:21:29.320	00:21:32.710	the general population. So in this country too this virus
296	00:21:32.720	00:21:35.090	is catching up with all of us, and we must
297	00:21:35.100	00:21:39.210	absolutely do something to stop its further spread. Based on
298	00:21:39.220	00:21:41.110	what you know--now, we just saw a report where
299	00:21:41.120	00:21:43.960	a man was fired from his job as an airline
300	00:21:43.970	00:21:46.200	flight attendant, where a child was being kept out of
301	00:21:46.210	00:21:51.040	school, another person, or a community, was opposed to having
302	00:21:51.050	00:21:54.830	a center set up for AIDS victims to live. Are
303	00:21:54.840	00:21:57.460	these actions justified based on what you know? No. These
304	00:21:57.470	00:22:01.330	actions are ridiculous and reflect only ignorance and fear due
305	00:22:01.340	00:22:07.230	to ignorance. AIDS itself is not transmitted. It is the
306	00:22:07.240	00:22:11.300	virus that renders people susceptible to AIDS that is transmitted
307	00:22:11.310	00:22:17.400	in the way I explained earlier. To segregate patients with
308	00:22:17.410	00:22:22.010	AIDS, with clinical symptoms of AIDS, does not protect anybody.
309	00:22:22.020	00:22:24.970	It causes a lot of heartbreak and injustice and does
310	00:22:24.980	00:22:28.590	not protect anybody. In fact, patients with clinical AIDS are
311	00:22:28.600	00:22:32.430	less infectious than people who have the virus and have
312	00:22:32.440	00:22:35.670	not yet developed clinical symptoms. But how do you reassure--
313	00:22:35.680	00:22:37.880	So it does not accomplish anything, quite the contrary, it
314	00:22:37.890	00:22:43.550	would provide a false reassurance. Everybody should be careful about
315	00:22:43.560	00:22:48.430	not contracting this infection, but it is not contracted through
316	00:22:48.440	00:22:51.970	living or rubbing elbows with patients with AIDS. And you
317	00:22:51.980	00:22:55.470	feel you can reassure everyone who's concerned with those--Yes,
318	00:22:55.480	00:23:01.300	very strongly so. Dr. Krim, stay with us. Robin? Despite
319	00:23:01.310	00:23:04.340	the reassurances we've just heard, the debate is not likely
320	00:23:04.350	00:23:08.060	to subside. Civil libertarians are becoming alarmed over what they
321	00:23:08.070	00:23:12.030	see as unjustified discrimination against AIDS victims, but even some
322	00:23:12.040	00:23:14.850	medical doctors worry that the general public is not being
323	00:23:14.860	00:23:19.550	adequately protected. Dr. Helen Singer Kaplan is one such physician.
324	00:23:19.560	00:23:22.250	She heads the Department of Human Sexuality at the New
325	00:23:22.260	00:23:25.660	York Hospital Cornell Medical Center. We also have with us
326	00:23:25.670	00:23:29.230	civil liberties lawyer Joe Tom Easely. He's the chairman of
327	00:23:29.240	00:23:32.360	the board of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund,
328	00:23:32.370	00:23:36.360	a group that provides legal services to the homosexual community.
329	00:23:36.370	00:23:39.660	Dr. Kaplan, first of all, what do you say to
330	00:23:39.670	00:23:42.900	Dr. Krim's remark that it would not be productive, it
331	00:23:42.910	00:23:47.980	would not protect anybody to segregate victims suffering from AIDS,
332	00:23:47.990	00:23:52.690	or to isolate them? Well, I have tremendous compassion for
333	00:23:52.700	00:23:55.030	"Bob" and some of the other people there, but as
334	00:23:55.040	00:23:58.640	I'm sitting here I can't wonder how many men have
335	00:23:58.650	00:24:01.500	they had sex with? How many men have they killed
336	00:24:01.510	00:24:05.240	with sex, how many people have they infected? And I
337	00:24:05.250	00:24:09.520	completely agree with Dr. Krim. The public has been kept
338	00:24:09.530	00:24:14.780	absolutely ignorant. We can prevent the further spread of AIDS.
339	00:24:14.790	00:24:18.420	There doesn't have to be a single new spread today
340	00:24:18.430	00:24:23.870	if we use the knowledge we have. Men like that--
341	00:24:23.880	00:24:29.530	male homosexuals have far more sex, more partners, than heterosexuals.
342	00:24:29.540	00:24:32.550	They may have as many as 500 to 1,000 a
343	00:24:32.560	00:24:35.790	year, and if a man doesn't know he's carrying the
344	00:24:35.800	00:24:39.990	virus, he can by himself spread it wildly. Let's confine
345	00:24:40.000	00:24:42.900	this to the moment for people who are known AIDS
346	00:24:42.910	00:24:45.950	sufferers at the moment, and we'll come to the people
347	00:24:45.960	00:24:48.360	who might be carrying the virus later. Do you believe
348	00:24:48.370	00:24:53.200	they should be isolated, quarantined, segregated? No, but I have--
349	00:24:53.210	00:24:57.120	some are still having sex with other people, and I
350	00:24:57.130	00:24:59.570	certainly think that is horrible. So they need to be
351	00:24:59.580	00:25:03.690	educated. Yes. They need to be educated. Educated, not segregated?
352	00:25:03.700	00:25:07.380	Yes. What do you think on this question of isolation
353	00:25:07.390	00:25:10.250	or quarantine, the things that were suggested, for instance, by
354	00:25:10.260	00:25:12.350	that group in Washington State? Well, I would like to
355	00:25:12.360	00:25:14.810	very strongly endorse what Dr. Krim said. It is a
356	00:25:14.820	00:25:18.130	matter of education and not a matter of segregation. The
357	00:25:18.140	00:25:21.660	kinds of hysteria that we're seeing, the kinds of responses
358	00:25:21.670	00:25:26.480	to a mounting national hysteria I think are dreadful. The
359	00:25:26.490	00:25:28.960	kind of incidents that we saw on the taped segment
360	00:25:28.970	00:25:32.490	a moment ago are just the tip of an iceberg.
361	00:25:32.500	00:25:36.270	At Lambda Legal Defense Fund we get every week, dozens
362	00:25:36.280	00:25:39.820	of calls not only from AIDS patients but from friends
363	00:25:39.830	00:25:43.790	of AIDS patients, acquaintances of AIDS patients, all of them
364	00:25:43.800	00:25:47.820	being discriminated against because they either have AIDS or they
365	00:25:47.830	00:25:50.500	are a friend of someone who has AIDS. We have
366	00:25:50.510	00:25:52.720	cases of people who have lost their jobs. We have
367	00:25:52.730	00:25:54.670	cases of people who have been thrown out of their
368	00:25:54.680	00:25:58.520	housing. We have cases of people who have been denied
369	00:25:58.530	00:26:02.070	social services, people that have been denied funeral services. people
370	00:26:02.080	00:26:08.140	have been denied the most rudimentary--Life insurance? Life insurance.
371	00:26:08.150	00:26:11.770	This kind of discrimination is widespread, and I think in
372	00:26:11.780	00:26:14.130	the last several weeks, in the last two months it
373	00:26:14.140	00:26:17.880	is increasing greatly. Do you think that it is hysteria
374	00:26:17.890	00:26:21.920	that is influencing the facts, or supposed facts, about the
375	00:26:21.930	00:26:25.620	spread of AIDS that is influencing public policy in places
376	00:26:25.630	00:26:31.110	like Mayor Koch's decision in this city that some children
377	00:26:31.120	00:26:33.410	should not go to school depending on the individual case?
378	00:26:33.420	00:26:39.910	Absolutely. The initiatives of segregation and discrimination are totally without
379	00:26:39.920	00:26:42.810	scientific basis. As Dr. Krim says--Dr. Krim is head
380	00:26:42.820	00:26:47.300	of the interferon laboratory at Memorial Sloane Kettering, one of
381	00:26:47.310	00:26:51.380	the most prestigious cancer institutions in this country. She is
382	00:26:51.390	00:26:56.110	expressing the view that has been repeatedly expressed by the
383	00:26:56.120	00:26:58.770	Public Health Service, by the National Institutes of Health, by
384	00:26:58.780	00:27:02.480	the Centers for Disease Control, every responsible scientific researcher in
385	00:27:02.490	00:27:05.220	the field of AIDS says exactly what Dr. Krim said.
386	00:27:05.230	00:27:08.900	This disease is not spread by casual contact. You cannot
387	00:27:08.910	00:27:10.880	get it by sitting next to somebody on a bus,
388	00:27:10.890	00:27:13.080	going to school with someone, living next door to someone,
389	00:27:13.090	00:27:15.920	having any kind of casual contact. Dr. Kaplan, as a
390	00:27:15.930	00:27:20.770	doctor yourself, and hearing the argument that Dr. Krim has
391	00:27:20.780	00:27:24.110	just made, do you think that hysteria is influencing public
392	00:27:24.120	00:27:27.290	policy? Yes, but I think the hysteria has been created
393	00:27:27.300	00:27:31.860	by a news blackout, by an obfuscating of the facts.
394	00:27:31.870	00:27:34.600	The gay community has fought long and hard for their
395	00:27:34.610	00:27:38.000	civil rights, but I think they were misguided in fighting
396	00:27:38.010	00:27:40.280	against the test. We can't give the test in New
397	00:27:40.290	00:27:43.280	York. It's not available. Half the cases in the world
398	00:27:43.290	00:27:46.300	come from New York. I think that if a gay
399	00:27:46.310	00:27:49.180	person has been exposed, he should want the test. And
400	00:27:49.190	00:27:52.840	if this were known, if the facts were known, there
401	00:27:52.850	00:27:55.810	would be no hysteria. The hysteria is due to a
402	00:27:55.820	00:27:58.590	lack of education and knowledge. Let me comment on that,
403	00:27:58.600	00:28:02.020	if I can. I think that is exactly wrong. First
404	00:28:02.030	00:28:04.800	of all, the gay community has nationally been at the
405	00:28:04.810	00:28:08.560	forefront of trying to encourage the federal government to spend
406	00:28:08.570	00:28:11.660	money on AIDS research. There have been millions of dollars
407	00:28:11.670	00:28:15.630	raised within the gay community itself to provide social services
408	00:28:15.640	00:28:19.630	to gay people who have AIDS. There has been a
409	00:28:19.640	00:28:22.240	very strong response, I think, from the community to press
410	00:28:22.250	00:28:24.880	the federal government, and there has been a foot-dragging on
411	00:28:24.890	00:28:26.420	the part of the federal government. First of all, as
412	00:28:26.430	00:28:28.960	far as the test goes, I think you're incorrect, Doctor,
413	00:28:28.970	00:28:33.020	in that the test is available here in New York.
414	00:28:33.030	00:28:35.270	Anybody who wants the test can get it here in
415	00:28:35.280	00:28:39.910	New York. There is no problem at all with that.
416	00:28:39.920	00:28:42.390	What is your view on the test being available here
417	00:28:42.400	00:28:44.870	in New York? Yes, the test is available for research
418	00:28:44.880	00:28:48.540	purposes. For research purposes, but not--so Dr. Kaplan is
419	00:28:48.550	00:28:51.420	right, it isn't generally available? It's available for blood, and
420	00:28:51.430	00:28:56.480	fortunately the gay community has been wonderful in raising money,
421	00:28:56.490	00:29:00.320	and there's been an unprecedented medical breakthrough in three short
422	00:29:00.330	00:29:04.200	years, and--We're going to go on to this question
423	00:29:04.210	00:29:06.690	of the test in a moment. I just want to
424	00:29:06.700	00:29:09.660	clear up, because there are many people living who have
425	00:29:09.670	00:29:13.150	children of school age who will be--the children went
426	00:29:13.160	00:29:15.520	back to school today, and presumably this is a question
427	00:29:15.530	00:29:20.730	in many people's minds. Are you absolutely sure that no,
428	00:29:20.740	00:29:24.000	with the categorical reassurance you gave earlier, that it would
429	00:29:24.010	00:29:27.670	not be dangerous for any child with AIDS to go
430	00:29:27.680	00:29:30.990	to school? That in cases where there were children who
431	00:29:31.000	00:29:34.920	were less controllable or something, who might be involved--or
432	00:29:34.930	00:29:39.180	where there could be bloodshed or students scratched or bitten
433	00:29:39.190	00:29:41.970	or whatever might happen in extreme circumstances--that in no
434	00:29:41.980	00:29:45.120	cases it would be dangerous for other children to have
435	00:29:45.130	00:29:47.710	an AIDS victim in the school? I think it may
436	00:29:47.720	00:29:50.950	be dangerous for the AIDS victim, because AIDS victims are
437	00:29:50.960	00:29:54.840	very susceptible to infections, and schools are notoriously sources of
438	00:29:54.850	00:29:58.860	infections for parents and siblings and so forth. So it
439	00:29:58.870	00:30:01.810	may not be appropriate for AIDS children to be in
440	00:30:01.820	00:30:05.180	school. But, yes, because AIDS patients can go through long
441	00:30:05.190	00:30:09.410	periods during which they are really not too sick, they
442	00:30:09.420	00:30:12.620	don't need to be hospitalized, they can very well function--
443	00:30:12.630	00:30:16.320	work, go to school. I think under the circumstances children
444	00:30:16.330	00:30:18.260	should be allowed to go to school. Do you agree
445	00:30:18.270	00:30:21.710	with that? I bow to Dr. Krim. It certainly sounds
446	00:30:21.720	00:30:24.530	right to me, yes. And do you believe as a
447	00:30:24.540	00:30:27.770	civil liberties lawyer in this case that the case of
448	00:30:27.780	00:30:31.140	the young boy in Kokomo, that his civil rights are
449	00:30:31.150	00:30:34.830	being somehow violated or abused by being prevented from going
450	00:30:34.840	00:30:38.040	to school? Absolutely. Absolutely. Dr. Kaplan talks about the AIDS
451	00:30:38.050	00:30:42.020	victims as if they're all gay men having sex with
452	00:30:42.030	00:30:45.500	500 people a year. Tell that story to the 13-year-old
453	00:30:45.510	00:30:48.860	in Kokomo, to the six-year-old in New Haven, Connecticut, to
454	00:30:48.870	00:30:51.490	all of the heterosexual women--There are about 180 children,
455	00:30:51.500	00:30:53.650	I believe, known to have the disease at the moment.
456	00:30:53.660	00:30:55.340	Yes, that's right. I think it would be of interest
457	00:30:55.350	00:30:57.580	to the public to know that most of these children
458	00:30:57.590	00:31:02.050	are infants born to mothers who were infected, and they
459	00:31:02.060	00:31:05.570	come down with clinical symptoms of disease several months after
460	00:31:05.580	00:31:08.610	birth. And many of them don't live beyond the age
461	00:31:08.620	00:31:12.000	of five years. I mean, so far most of them
462	00:31:12.010	00:31:14.780	have not lived beyond that so that the question of
463	00:31:14.790	00:31:19.820	school for them hardly exists. Most of the children of
464	00:31:19.830	00:31:22.380	older age who have AIDS--and there are very few
465	00:31:22.390	00:31:24.290	of those, I think there are seven in the whole
466	00:31:24.300	00:31:28.050	of the New York City school system--are boys who
467	00:31:28.060	00:31:32.730	were born with hemophilia. As a treatment for this genetic
468	00:31:32.740	00:31:37.060	disease they need to be given blood or blood products.
469	00:31:37.070	00:31:41.020	By mischance, in the past before we had the test
470	00:31:41.030	00:31:45.980	to keep the blood pool clean of the virus, some
471	00:31:45.990	00:31:49.380	people, including some of these children, have received contaminated blood
472	00:31:49.390	00:31:52.100	and are now infected and have developed AIDS. But these
473	00:31:52.110	00:31:56.670	are older children of an age where you can explain
474	00:31:56.680	00:31:59.740	certain things, you know, and they know they are sick,
475	00:31:59.750	00:32:02.110	and they can very well behave in such a way
476	00:32:02.120	00:32:06.780	as not to cause any danger to anyone. Let's move
477	00:32:06.790	00:32:10.570	on now. We'll come back. Judy? AIDS victims are not
478	00:32:10.580	00:32:13.730	the only focus of public fears. There are also those
479	00:32:13.740	00:32:16.630	who show no symptoms but have been exposed to the
480	00:32:16.640	00:32:20.050	virus and may be contagious. These people can now be
481	00:32:20.060	00:32:23.160	identified, as we've just heard, by a blood test. June
482	00:32:23.170	00:32:29.550	Cross examines the test's implications. It's known as ELISA. It
483	00:32:29.560	00:32:33.140	can't actually isolate the AIDS virus itself, but it can
484	00:32:33.150	00:32:36.860	detect whether someone's been exposed to AIDS by indicating the
485	00:32:36.870	00:32:40.610	presence of antibodies trying to fight the disease. It's been
486	00:32:40.620	00:32:44.040	proven so effective that the Pentagon announced last week that
487	00:32:44.050	00:32:47.490	it would be administered to new recruits. Since it's certain
488	00:32:47.500	00:32:52.650	now that AIDS can be spread directly through blood transfusions
489	00:32:52.660	00:32:55.110	and since in time of war, or even in times
490	00:32:55.120	00:33:00.510	of smaller mass casualties than war, we rely on direct
491	00:33:00.520	00:33:04.610	transfusions from one soldier to another in the field, and
492	00:33:04.620	00:33:08.830	therefore couldn't screen out those who might have this antibody
493	00:33:08.840	00:33:13.180	and could therefore endanger the lives of wounded soldiers, this
494	00:33:13.190	00:33:19.500	was a simple, prudent, conservative medical step to take. Aside
495	00:33:19.510	00:33:23.370	from the military, blood donation centers and special testing sites
496	00:33:23.380	00:33:27.940	for high-risk groups are screening people for the AIDS antibodies.
497	00:33:27.950	00:33:30.420	You've given before? Yes. Okay, I'm going to ask you
498	00:33:30.430	00:33:33.920	all sorts of questions. While the blood test does seem
499	00:33:33.930	00:33:37.530	to provide a high degree of security for blood recipients,
500	00:33:37.540	00:33:40.470	the most recent evidence is that only 10% of those
501	00:33:40.480	00:33:44.020	with the antibody itself will ever die from the disease.
502	00:33:44.030	00:33:46.970	It does not prove he's infectious to somebody else. It
503	00:33:46.980	00:33:49.550	does not prove he's going to come down with AIDS.
504	00:33:49.560	00:33:51.900	On the other hand, we're really not able to guarantee
505	00:33:51.910	00:33:54.440	that none of those things will happen. A score of
506	00:33:54.450	00:33:57.090	companies are working on a test that would be available
507	00:33:57.100	00:33:59.930	in drugstores. The first of these should be on the
508	00:33:59.940	00:34:03.620	market before the year is out. Meanwhile, the test itself
509	00:34:03.630	00:34:06.540	has raised a whole set of thorny issues surrounding what
510	00:34:06.550	00:34:10.390	could happen to those whose test turns out positive. Your
511	00:34:10.400	00:34:13.320	employer may find some way to get rid of you,
512	00:34:13.330	00:34:17.320	or you may not be hirable, or your insurance company
513	00:34:17.330	00:34:20.380	will no longer carry you because the costs involved in
514	00:34:20.390	00:34:24.120	treating people with AIDS are phenomenal. So far, only very
515	00:34:24.130	00:34:27.940	small insurance companies in California are dropping AIDS patients from
516	00:34:27.950	00:34:31.840	their rolls, but the gay community, already stigmatized by this
517	00:34:31.850	00:34:35.100	disease, is fearful that test results could end up in
518	00:34:35.110	00:34:39.930	the wrong hands. We are so scared, we just don't
519	00:34:39.940	00:34:42.870	have any trust in the government. I don't. I have
520	00:34:42.880	00:34:45.610	absolutely none. Neither does anybody in the gay community. Every
521	00:34:45.620	00:34:52.670	time lists get made that are supposed to be confidential,
522	00:34:52.680	00:34:55.350	those lists somehow end up in the places they're not
523	00:34:55.360	00:34:58.670	ever intended to be. So, on the one hand, I
524	00:34:58.680	00:35:01.110	see it being vital and useful. On the other hand,
525	00:35:01.120	00:35:06.560	I see it being as a vehicle to further discriminate
526	00:35:06.570	00:35:10.360	against people who are not the most acceptable in our
527	00:35:10.370	00:35:15.930	society. In most states the results of the AIDS blood
528	00:35:15.940	00:35:20.400	test are by law strictly confidential, but Colorado public health
529	00:35:20.410	00:35:23.690	officials think that information from the blood test can be
530	00:35:23.700	00:35:26.840	put to use in preventing the spread of AIDS. Here
531	00:35:26.850	00:35:30.900	to explain the plan is Dr. Thomas Vernon, executive director
532	00:35:30.910	00:35:34.530	of the Colorado Department of Health. Dr. Vernon, how exactly
533	00:35:34.540	00:35:38.110	do you want to use the results of this information?
534	00:35:38.120	00:35:40.490	Well, we want to use the information the way we
535	00:35:40.500	00:35:45.300	have used positive laboratory tests from many other diseases for
536	00:35:45.310	00:35:50.190	a very long time. We have about 30 laboratory tests
537	00:35:50.200	00:35:53.350	which are reportable to the state health department to go
538	00:35:53.360	00:35:57.410	into our confidential files. The point is that we need
539	00:35:57.420	00:35:59.870	to get on with it in terms of AIDS, doing
540	00:35:59.880	00:36:02.000	what we know how to do, what we have done
541	00:36:02.010	00:36:05.820	well for many, many years with other diseases--measles, Colorado
542	00:36:05.830	00:36:10.320	tick fever, syphilis is the best analogy. So who then
543	00:36:10.330	00:36:12.210	would you be getting the results from, the blood test
544	00:36:12.220	00:36:16.540	results from? Well, the blood tests would be reported to
545	00:36:16.550	00:36:19.810	us from any laboratory in the state which does the
546	00:36:19.820	00:36:23.510	blood test by law. And, incidentally, by law these are
547	00:36:23.520	00:36:28.210	confidential tests. We have years of experience with our system
548	00:36:28.220	00:36:32.120	of confidentiality and there has been no break in that.
549	00:36:32.130	00:36:33.800	All right, before we get to the question of confidentiality,
550	00:36:33.810	00:36:37.510	why are you doing it? We're doing it because--at
551	00:36:37.520	00:36:41.670	least a couple of reasons. One is we don't have
552	00:36:41.680	00:36:44.590	a vaccine for the disease. We don't have a definitive
553	00:36:44.600	00:36:47.570	treatment for the disease. What we do have is the
554	00:36:47.580	00:36:52.900	ability to provide adept and skilled counseling to individuals who
555	00:36:52.910	00:36:56.370	have it. We need to think of counseling as our
556	00:36:56.380	00:36:59.930	modern-day vaccine, at least for the short term. The second
557	00:36:59.940	00:37:04.340	reason is that I think we need to be demonstrating
558	00:37:04.350	00:37:07.160	to the American public that we are doing at least
559	00:37:07.170	00:37:09.500	as much for AIDS as we know how to do
560	00:37:09.510	00:37:12.270	and are already doing for many other diseases. Well, what
561	00:37:12.280	00:37:14.190	exactly do you mean? I mean, once you get the
562	00:37:14.200	00:37:16.200	names, what will you do? Will you go out and
563	00:37:16.210	00:37:20.070	contact these people or what? Well, again, syphilis is the
564	00:37:20.080	00:37:25.260	best analogy, and we've been using our ability to contact
565	00:37:25.270	00:37:29.420	individuals with syphilis as a means of controlling that disease
566	00:37:29.430	00:37:35.220	for at least 15 to 20 years. Our laboratory report,
567	00:37:35.230	00:37:37.280	for example, will come in to us with a physician's
568	00:37:37.290	00:37:40.770	name on that report. Our practice is to contact the
569	00:37:40.780	00:37:44.290	physician who has submitted the report and determine what are
570	00:37:44.300	00:37:47.960	the circumstances of that patient and does that physician need
571	00:37:47.970	00:37:51.230	assistance? Would it be helpful to that physician for us
572	00:37:51.240	00:37:54.740	to assist in contacting the patient? If the physician has
573	00:37:54.750	00:37:57.600	it under control, then so be it. There's no reason
574	00:37:57.610	00:38:00.040	for public health to be further involved. Would you make
575	00:38:00.050	00:38:03.780	an attempt, for example, to contact any sexual partners of
576	00:38:03.790	00:38:09.310	a person identified as having the virus? I think in
577	00:38:09.320	00:38:13.820	the occasion we would when there was evidence of a
578	00:38:13.830	00:38:18.520	particular spread. One example that I think is of importance,
579	00:38:18.530	00:38:21.540	because it may illustrate a form of this disease which
580	00:38:21.550	00:38:26.090	is absolutely preventable, and that is that infection in utero.
581	00:38:26.100	00:38:30.490	Our ability to get counseling to the, for example, bisexual
582	00:38:30.500	00:38:32.980	male who is married to a woman in the childbearing
583	00:38:32.990	00:38:36.170	age or who has had sexual contact with a woman
584	00:38:36.180	00:38:39.610	who may be pregnant or may want to become pregnant
585	00:38:39.620	00:38:42.700	may in fact result in the prevention of an in
586	00:38:42.710	00:38:45.830	utero infection. It seems to me that that's an extremely
587	00:38:45.840	00:38:49.590	important outcome. You say you are certain that you can
588	00:38:49.600	00:38:52.510	keep these names confidential. How can you be so sure
589	00:38:52.520	00:38:54.230	of that? I mean, that, after all, is what we've
590	00:38:54.240	00:38:57.640	just heard so many members of the gay community are
591	00:38:57.650	00:39:03.010	concerned about. Well, not only are we certain because of
592	00:39:03.020	00:39:08.770	the system of file protection and locks and staff work
593	00:39:08.780	00:39:12.010	that we have, but we have a history of success.
594	00:39:12.020	00:39:15.770	We have not had, and have never had to, release
595	00:39:15.780	00:39:19.970	information to insurers, to employers, to law enforcement agents, to
596	00:39:19.980	00:39:22.980	the general public, to family members. We simply don't release
597	00:39:22.990	00:39:25.870	the information. We have enough experience that I think we
598	00:39:25.880	00:39:28.670	can say with a great deal of confidence that this
599	00:39:28.680	00:39:31.430	will not occur with our AIDS reports. What argument do
600	00:39:31.440	00:39:34.920	you use to the person who thinks he may have
601	00:39:34.930	00:39:41.470	been exposed to AIDS to risk, you know, losing confidentiality,
602	00:39:41.480	00:39:44.990	when he knows there's no treatment, no cure, for a
603	00:39:45.000	00:39:48.880	disease that he may have? Well, the argument is, to
604	00:39:48.890	00:39:52.080	the high-risk group as well as to the general public,
605	00:39:52.090	00:39:54.970	we have some skills to bring to bear on this
606	00:39:54.980	00:39:58.810	disease that may help. It may help you as a
607	00:39:58.820	00:40:02.470	high-risk individual. It may help you understand better the disease
608	00:40:02.480	00:40:07.990	and your ability not to transmit it further. The fact
609	00:40:08.000	00:40:10.930	that we have now a blood test which is a
610	00:40:10.940	00:40:15.090	major advance over where we were only six months ago,
611	00:40:15.100	00:40:20.040	a disease with a one- to five-year incubation period. We
612	00:40:20.050	00:40:22.510	now have a lead on an individual who could be
613	00:40:22.520	00:40:26.450	infectious for many years before they in fact would come
614	00:40:26.460	00:40:30.930	down with the disease. Dr. Vernon, stay with us. Robin?
615	00:40:30.940	00:40:34.310	Mr. Easely, what do you think of the Colorado plan?
616	00:40:34.320	00:40:38.260	Well, it's difficult to argue against something that is so
617	00:40:38.270	00:40:43.860	plausibly scientific. It is an appealing argument that how can
618	00:40:43.870	00:40:47.820	you argue against a test here that can lead to
619	00:40:47.830	00:40:53.720	another scientific miracle, adding another magic bullet to the arsenal
620	00:40:53.730	00:40:56.170	of the ones we already have? But let's look at
621	00:40:56.180	00:40:58.670	this test and find out exactly what it is showing.
622	00:40:58.680	00:41:00.590	Unlike what Dr. Vernon said, and I think he would
623	00:41:00.600	00:41:03.170	agree if asked on this, that this is not the
624	00:41:03.180	00:41:05.930	kind of test, like a syphilis test or the kind
625	00:41:05.940	00:41:08.540	of other test, that will show you whether or not
626	00:41:08.550	00:41:12.400	you have the disease. This test is going to identify
627	00:41:12.410	00:41:17.650	a very large number of people, only 10% of whom
628	00:41:17.660	00:41:20.620	are likely to ever come down with AIDS itself. So
629	00:41:20.630	00:41:23.690	the people who are identified positive by this test--first
630	00:41:23.700	00:41:27.320	of all, everybody will not have the disease, and of
631	00:41:27.330	00:41:30.290	those who will ever in their lifetime get the disease,
632	00:41:30.300	00:41:34.010	they're only going to be 10%. Now, the federal government
633	00:41:34.020	00:41:37.050	has taken the position--the FDA in its licensing of
634	00:41:37.060	00:41:39.380	this test, has taken the position that this test has
635	00:41:39.390	00:41:44.810	no diagnostic or therapeutic value for AIDS at all, that
636	00:41:44.820	00:41:47.730	it is a screening test and screening test alone. Now,
637	00:41:47.740	00:41:49.970	the kind of issue that's come up in Colorado has
638	00:41:49.980	00:41:51.830	come up in other states as well. New Jersey just
639	00:41:51.840	00:41:55.330	finished examining the same issue, whether or not the state
640	00:41:55.340	00:41:58.430	health department should in effect make a positive report on
641	00:41:58.440	00:42:01.310	the test reportable; New Jersey decided against it. There's a
642	00:42:01.320	00:42:03.830	great deal of controversy in Colorado about this, I might
643	00:42:03.840	00:42:06.490	say. The head of the largest blood bank in Denver
644	00:42:06.500	00:42:09.540	was opposed--So what are you saying? They should--What
645	00:42:09.550	00:42:12.690	I'm saying is the problems involved, the problems that are
646	00:42:12.700	00:42:17.140	inherent in the reporting of this kind of test, greatly
647	00:42:17.150	00:42:22.030	outweigh any advantage in terms of therapy or scientific research
648	00:42:22.040	00:42:25.300	right now to giving of the test widely. Do you
649	00:42:25.310	00:42:29.480	agree, Dr. Krim, that using the test in the way
650	00:42:29.490	00:42:34.900	Dr. Vernon described could help prevent the spread of AIDS?
651	00:42:34.910	00:42:36.820	I think there are better ways to prevent the spread
652	00:42:36.830	00:42:39.680	of AIDS, and the better ways are to inform the
653	00:42:39.690	00:42:44.460	public on exactly how AIDS can be transmitted from people
654	00:42:44.470	00:42:49.820	to people. The best--you see, the test--as we
655	00:42:49.830	00:42:53.560	just heard, the test identifies people exposed to the virus,
656	00:42:53.570	00:42:58.540	not people who are sick. Can I interrupt one moment
657	00:42:58.550	00:43:03.020	to clarify a piece of information for me? If 100
658	00:43:03.030	00:43:05.990	people have been exposed to the virus but only 10%
659	00:43:06.000	00:43:09.440	of them may later get AIDS, are the other 90%
660	00:43:09.450	00:43:13.910	carrying something communicable? Yes. Yes. They are carriers of the
661	00:43:13.920	00:43:16.020	disease even though they may not get the disease themselves?
662	00:43:16.030	00:43:18.030	They are carriers of the virus, not the disease. Of
663	00:43:18.040	00:43:21.320	the virus, I beg your pardon. And can they communicate
664	00:43:21.330	00:43:23.440	that to other people? Yes, they can, if they remain
665	00:43:23.450	00:43:27.300	ignorant and not aware of their being infected and not
666	00:43:27.310	00:43:30.670	aware of how they can transmit the disease. This is
667	00:43:30.680	00:43:33.460	why the test, we were just saying with Dr. Kaplan,
668	00:43:33.470	00:43:37.520	that the test should be available to everybody. And the
669	00:43:37.530	00:43:40.890	people who would request it done would be people who
670	00:43:40.900	00:43:43.640	have reasons to believe that they may have been exposed,
671	00:43:43.650	00:43:46.880	and it should certainly be available to them. So that
672	00:43:46.890	00:43:52.220	they can adjust their life, their lifestyle, their behavior accordingly,
673	00:43:52.230	00:43:56.030	and become, you know, protect others that they deal with
674	00:43:56.040	00:43:59.400	sexually. What do you think of Colorado's plan to--I
675	00:43:59.410	00:44:04.000	am appalled at the obfuscating that just because 10% come
676	00:44:04.010	00:44:07.460	down--that's not why we give the test. We try
677	00:44:07.470	00:44:11.560	to identify carriers, and the fact that there was political
678	00:44:11.570	00:44:13.780	pressure in New York City, I have to send my
679	00:44:13.790	00:44:16.610	patients to New Jersey to get the test. This is
680	00:44:16.620	00:44:19.780	exactly where the test should be available. I would think
681	00:44:19.790	00:44:23.180	that any person who's been exposed in good conscience would
682	00:44:23.190	00:44:25.690	want to be tested so they don't kill their loved
683	00:44:25.700	00:44:27.870	ones. But what about the use of the test that
684	00:44:27.880	00:44:30.890	Dr. Vernon--I completely agree with Dr. Krim that it
685	00:44:30.900	00:44:37.190	should not be mandatory, but it certainly should be widely
686	00:44:37.200	00:44:41.440	available and the gay community should encourage the use of
687	00:44:41.450	00:44:45.030	it rather than having put political pressure to stop the
688	00:44:45.040	00:44:46.470	use of it. Yeah, but there are reasons why the
689	00:44:46.480	00:44:51.360	gay community for a long time recommended that its members
690	00:44:51.370	00:44:54.900	not avail themselves of the existence of this test, and
691	00:44:54.910	00:44:58.560	the reasons are simply that the gay community is a
692	00:44:58.570	00:45:02.300	community, is a group in our population that can legally
693	00:45:02.310	00:45:05.400	be discriminated against, and they had very good reasons to
694	00:45:05.410	00:45:09.590	think that as long as they were the major victims
695	00:45:09.600	00:45:12.190	of this disease and this infection, the test will be
696	00:45:12.200	00:45:15.920	used to identify gay men and discriminate against them, and
697	00:45:15.930	00:45:18.250	we know that this is happening. What--let me go
698	00:45:18.260	00:45:21.880	back to Dr. Vernon with Mr. Easely's point that the
699	00:45:21.890	00:45:25.960	problems and complications of the use of the test outweigh
700	00:45:25.970	00:45:29.010	any advantages you might be able to derive from using
701	00:45:29.020	00:45:31.940	it the way you propose? Dr. Krim and Dr. Kaplan
702	00:45:31.950	00:45:34.870	are absolutely correct. This test is far more than we
703	00:45:34.880	00:45:37.050	thought it was when it was first released six months
704	00:45:37.060	00:45:40.830	ago. It is not just a screening test. In the
705	00:45:40.840	00:45:45.090	Red Cross studies, 60% of those individuals with a high
706	00:45:45.100	00:45:49.970	antibody against the AIDS virus were culture-positive. These are individuals
707	00:45:49.980	00:45:52.630	who are carrying the virus and who are infectious for
708	00:45:52.640	00:45:56.680	others. We're talking about our ability to get information to
709	00:45:56.690	00:46:02.070	people who don't otherwise know what to do with their
710	00:46:02.080	00:46:06.340	blood test results or with their sexual behavior. With all
711	00:46:06.350	00:46:08.950	that, doesn't it make it logical for as many people
712	00:46:08.960	00:46:11.270	who suspect they may have had contact to submit to
713	00:46:11.280	00:46:15.120	the test? It's logical for there to be the widest
714	00:46:15.130	00:46:19.650	possible education program in the community, in the gay community
715	00:46:19.660	00:46:23.780	and in the heterosexual community about the dangers of AIDS
716	00:46:23.790	00:46:26.800	and the kinds of safe sex that people can engage
717	00:46:26.810	00:46:29.040	in. But the problem with this test--But you're shaking
718	00:46:29.050	00:46:31.730	your head violently. There's no safe sex. There's no safe
719	00:46:31.740	00:46:35.120	sex. There is safer sex. Safer, but there is no
720	00:46:35.130	00:46:38.630	safe sex. They have to stop having sex or only
721	00:46:38.640	00:46:41.240	have sex with other people who are positive for the
722	00:46:41.250	00:46:45.490	virus. That's rather impractical advice to give to everybody because
723	00:46:45.500	00:46:48.780	I believe that everybody should be educated, not only the
724	00:46:48.790	00:46:51.760	people in the high-risk groups. And it's true. There is
725	00:46:51.770	00:46:55.050	not absolutely safe sex, but there are certain practices that
726	00:46:55.060	00:46:59.820	certainly reduce greatly the danger of becoming infected. I'm afraid
727	00:46:59.830	00:47:02.240	that we've spent a lot of time on this but
728	00:47:02.250	00:47:03.760	we have come to the end of it, and we
729	00:47:03.770	00:47:05.750	have to leave it there. Thank you all. Thank you,
730	00:47:05.760	00:47:10.060	Dr. Vernon, in Colorado; Dr. Krim, Mr. Easely and Dr.
731	00:47:10.070	00:47:21.470	Kaplan in New York. Judy? Hopes to ease the federal
732	00:47:21.480	00:47:25.330	budget deficit and administration plans to move farmers to a
733	00:47:25.340	00:47:29.000	freer market suffered a severe setback today. The head of
734	00:47:29.010	00:47:33.210	the nation's largest farm lending institution, the federal Farm Credit
735	00:47:33.220	00:47:37.070	Administration, says that his agency needs federal help to keep
736	00:47:37.080	00:47:40.690	it afloat. Donald Wilkinson told the Wall Street Journal the
737	00:47:40.700	00:47:44.990	Farm Credit System cannot handle the $11 billion losses that
738	00:47:45.000	00:47:48.730	it faces. Just weeks ago Wilkinson had insisted that the
739	00:47:48.740	00:47:52.190	Farm Credit System would not need a federal bailout, but
740	00:47:52.200	00:47:55.730	now he says that farm economic problems have outflanked his
741	00:47:55.740	00:47:59.810	agency's worst-case planning. The Farm Credit System is similar to
742	00:47:59.820	00:48:03.250	a giant credit union. It sells bonds on Wall Street
743	00:48:03.260	00:48:06.930	and uses the proceeds to loan money to individual farmers
744	00:48:06.940	00:48:10.140	through a series of district banks. It is a system
745	00:48:10.150	00:48:14.060	that farmers have come to rely on. Recently Kwame Holman
746	00:48:14.070	00:48:23.050	reported on the economic storm clouds rocking the $74-billion institution.
747	00:48:23.060	00:48:26.200	The biggest bank in America is in trouble, but the
748	00:48:26.210	00:48:29.760	people involved won't be found here in the financial heartland
749	00:48:29.770	00:48:32.750	of Wall Street, but in the rural heartland of the
750	00:48:32.760	00:48:36.240	farm belt. The largest bank in the nation is the
751	00:48:36.250	00:48:40.890	Farm Credit System, a giant network of farmer-run credit unions
752	00:48:40.900	00:48:45.120	or cooperatives that took shape during the Great Depression. With
753	00:48:45.130	00:48:48.220	a pool of federal money, the farmers of that era
754	00:48:48.230	00:48:51.880	set up a member cooperative to give themselves farm loans
755	00:48:51.890	00:48:56.220	they couldn't get anywhere else. Today, the system holds more
756	00:48:56.230	00:49:02.050	than $80 billion in loans for farmland, crops and livestock,
757	00:49:02.060	00:49:05.890	but now the system has a problem. American agriculture is
758	00:49:05.900	00:49:09.510	in its worst decline since the 1930s, and a huge
759	00:49:09.520	00:49:12.910	crop this fall is expected to drive down prices even
760	00:49:12.920	00:49:16.300	further, sapping the ability of some farmers to repay their
761	00:49:16.310	00:49:21.280	loans. Iowa Congressman Jim Leach. Basically the Farm Credit System
762	00:49:21.290	00:49:24.850	is teetering on the brink of insolvency. Because of the
763	00:49:24.860	00:49:28.410	losses, the system announced this week that, contrary to earlier
764	00:49:28.420	00:49:31.910	statements, it will need financial help, most likely from the
765	00:49:31.920	00:49:35.450	federal government. The announcement should be good news to farmers
766	00:49:35.460	00:49:37.750	like these who say that they have borne the brunt
767	00:49:37.760	00:49:40.670	of the pain in keeping the system solvent, and that
768	00:49:40.680	00:49:43.700	control of the system is being taken away from farmers
769	00:49:43.710	00:49:47.620	by bureaucrats of the Farm Credit System administration. This is
770	00:49:47.630	00:49:51.000	a crucial time for that system because the way that
771	00:49:51.010	00:49:54.040	system will look in the future, the basic parameters of
772	00:49:54.050	00:49:56.490	that system are going to be determined in the next
773	00:49:56.500	00:50:01.240	several weeks. How did the Farm Credit System get into
774	00:50:01.250	00:50:04.100	such trouble? It started in the boom days of the
775	00:50:04.110	00:50:08.540	1970s when crop prices and land values were rising. The
776	00:50:08.550	00:50:12.160	farmer cooperatives, like the commercial banks, lent lots of money
777	00:50:12.170	00:50:17.880	to farmers. The system, frankly, rewarded those who made more
778	00:50:17.890	00:50:20.610	loans. In fact, bonuses were given to people who made
779	00:50:20.620	00:50:26.620	more loans. That was a prescription for basically a loose
780	00:50:26.630	00:50:30.470	credit policy. Ray Powell was a loan officer with the
781	00:50:30.480	00:50:34.030	Farm Credit System in Creston, Iowa. It was just a
782	00:50:34.040	00:50:37.100	fever throughout the whole system to do that. I've heard
783	00:50:37.110	00:50:40.880	comments that people were out almost handing people money and
784	00:50:40.890	00:50:42.790	trying to talk them into putting up this silo or
785	00:50:42.800	00:50:46.260	do that sort of thing. But today land like this
786	00:50:46.270	00:50:48.950	is worth half of what it was ten years ago,
787	00:50:48.960	00:50:57.390	and many farmers can't make the payments on those loans.
788	00:50:57.400	00:51:01.720	Without those loan payments, local credit associations face millions in
789	00:51:01.730	00:51:06.500	losses. The association in Creston, Iowa, is typical. When deficits
790	00:51:06.510	00:51:09.890	started to pile up, the credit association here looked to
791	00:51:09.900	00:51:13.420	the system's district office in Omaha for help. They found
792	00:51:13.430	00:51:16.710	out there was a price for that help. Tom Langemeier
793	00:51:16.720	00:51:19.940	is the former head of the association in Creston. The
794	00:51:19.950	00:51:24.030	associations don't have the money to handle the problem. There
795	00:51:24.040	00:51:26.030	is just no way that they've got the money. So
796	00:51:26.040	00:51:30.800	they're looking to the district bank for money. And anytime
797	00:51:30.810	00:51:34.340	you ask for money and you can't control the situation
798	00:51:34.350	00:51:36.730	out there, there's going to be a lot of strings,
799	00:51:36.740	00:51:40.100	and there's an awful lot of strings. A credit institution
800	00:51:40.110	00:51:42.600	has to recognize that it has some borrowers who are
801	00:51:42.610	00:51:46.020	having difficulty. It has to determine, is it going to
802	00:51:46.030	00:51:49.730	eliminate those borrowers? And that has to be a decision,
803	00:51:49.740	00:51:54.020	a cold-blooded business decision. This is the man who farmers
804	00:51:54.030	00:51:57.550	say is pulling the strings, Farm Credit System Governor Donald
805	00:51:57.560	00:52:00.490	Wilkinson, the man who made the announcement that despite the
806	00:52:00.500	00:52:03.670	belt-tightening farmers have done, the system will need help from
807	00:52:03.680	00:52:08.820	the outside. In Creston, that sacrifice already is costing farmers
808	00:52:08.830	00:52:12.400	money. They are fighting for control of a system they
809	00:52:12.410	00:52:16.350	once thought was their friend. The struggle centers on the
810	00:52:16.360	00:52:20.430	production credit associations, that part of the Farm Credit System
811	00:52:20.440	00:52:24.070	that loans money to farmers for crops and machinery. Every
812	00:52:24.080	00:52:27.330	time a production credit association makes a loan, it holds
813	00:52:27.340	00:52:31.350	10% of the loan amount in reserve. In May, without
814	00:52:31.360	00:52:35.780	any warning to farmers, the Creston production credit association decided
815	00:52:35.790	00:52:39.720	to freeze that 10% on all of its loans. Essentially
816	00:52:39.730	00:52:42.260	what that means for farmers is that paying off their
817	00:52:42.270	00:52:45.830	loans now is going to cost them 10% more. At
818	00:52:45.840	00:52:48.380	the time they froze the stock, I had to sell
819	00:52:48.390	00:52:54.010	cattle right after that to get my loan balance down.
820	00:52:54.020	00:52:57.440	Farmer Leo Tucker will lose money because of the freezing
821	00:52:57.450	00:53:00.830	of his 10% reserve, known as Beef stock, in the
822	00:53:00.840	00:53:05.090	Creston association. Effectively, the interest rate on his loan has
823	00:53:05.100	00:53:08.260	been increased, and if he tries to buy out that
824	00:53:08.270	00:53:10.830	loan and move it to another bank, it will cost
825	00:53:10.840	00:53:15.200	him an extra $12,000. The idea of freezing stock is
826	00:53:15.210	00:53:18.310	to keep farmers in the system. The whole Farm Credit
827	00:53:18.320	00:53:21.180	System, I think, could maybe have got on top of
828	00:53:21.190	00:53:24.250	the situation just a little quicker. Then when they did
829	00:53:24.260	00:53:28.220	it was kind of an overreaction. I feel bitter against
830	00:53:28.230	00:53:32.120	PCA to the extent that, I mean, you know, it
831	00:53:32.130	00:53:39.400	just increased my debt $12,000. Governor Wilkinson, a presidential employee
832	00:53:39.410	00:53:44.290	or appointee, doesn't care what members want or what impact
833	00:53:44.300	00:53:47.200	the freezing of Beef stock or possible liquidation may have
834	00:53:47.210	00:53:50.080	on the member borrowers. In fact, he has done everything
835	00:53:50.090	00:53:52.790	in his power to take away all rights from members.
836	00:53:52.800	00:53:56.190	Humiliation and fear tactics have effectively neutered local boards that
837	00:53:56.200	00:54:00.450	are still intact. Farmers at the Creston association recently sought
838	00:54:00.460	00:54:03.750	the help of Iowa Congressman Jim Lightfoot in their battle
839	00:54:03.760	00:54:07.370	with the system's administration. When do you think that loss
840	00:54:07.380	00:54:11.040	of control took place? Ultimately, though, the question for these
841	00:54:11.050	00:54:14.350	farmers may not be who runs the system today, but
842	00:54:14.360	00:54:17.460	who will support it tomorrow. What's happening is that a
843	00:54:17.470	00:54:20.540	lot of farmers that are strong and can get out
844	00:54:20.550	00:54:24.300	are getting out, leaving the system with weaker credit arrangements.
845	00:54:24.310	00:54:27.470	At this recent meeting between Congressman Jim Leach and eastern
846	00:54:27.480	00:54:30.650	Iowa farmers, the talk was that higher interest rates and
847	00:54:30.660	00:54:33.090	stock freezes are causing an exodus of some of the
848	00:54:33.100	00:54:38.080	system's best farmers. The bad news has been surprisingly slow
849	00:54:38.090	00:54:40.930	to reach Wall Street. This is where the Farm Credit
850	00:54:40.940	00:54:44.180	System takes orders from investors who want to buy system
851	00:54:44.190	00:54:47.560	bonds, the source of the loan money to farmers. Until
852	00:54:47.570	00:54:51.470	recently, farm credit bonds were considered a very safe investment,
853	00:54:51.480	00:54:54.390	selling at interest rates almost as low as government treasury
854	00:54:54.400	00:54:57.510	bills, even though system bonds aren't backed by the federal
855	00:54:57.520	00:55:01.860	government. Today farm credit rates are rising dramatically as investors
856	00:55:01.870	00:55:05.860	begin to understand the system's troubles. Still, many are convinced
857	00:55:05.870	00:55:08.280	that the government would bail out the system if it
858	00:55:08.290	00:55:11.480	ever started to collapse. It will not be allowed to
859	00:55:11.490	00:55:16.010	fail, in my view. As a country, as a matter
860	00:55:16.020	00:55:20.160	of policy, we took that stance with respect to Continental
861	00:55:20.170	00:55:27.720	Illinois. This is about twice Continental. It's about two Continentals.
862	00:55:27.730	00:55:29.500	And I think it simply is too big a part
863	00:55:29.510	00:55:34.080	of the financial part of the country for it to
864	00:55:34.090	00:55:38.460	fail. The revelation that the system will seek outside revenues
865	00:55:38.470	00:55:43.060	was preceded by unprecedented shifts of capital inside the system
866	00:55:43.070	00:55:47.380	to shore up its ailing districts. The Spokane, Washington, district
867	00:55:47.390	00:55:51.970	was first, getting $150 million from the system last June.
868	00:55:51.980	00:55:54.930	Last month, the troubled Omaha district, the one that bailed
869	00:55:54.940	00:55:58.560	out the Creston association, got bailed out itself with almost
870	00:55:58.570	00:56:03.320	$350 million from Farm Credit System banks around the country.
871	00:56:03.330	00:56:06.170	But the system is feeding on itself, and many outside
872	00:56:06.180	00:56:08.540	the system say that the federal government will have to
873	00:56:08.550	00:56:11.990	step in to keep the system afloat. I am personally
874	00:56:12.000	00:56:15.500	convinced that it needs financial assistance and it needs it
875	00:56:15.510	00:56:21.230	very quickly, that another year's wait will be too late.
876	00:56:21.240	00:56:24.200	The system is not facing demise. Right now we believe
877	00:56:24.210	00:56:27.920	this system has the resources to handle its own problems.
878	00:56:27.930	00:56:31.860	To do so, however, will require that the situation not
879	00:56:31.870	00:56:37.410	worsen to a degree that we had not anticipated. Any
880	00:56:37.420	00:56:41.790	data at the Washington level are stale at a time
881	00:56:41.800	00:56:44.870	when values are changing as rapidly as they have been,
882	00:56:44.880	00:56:49.030	when you're losing up to 20% or even a greater
883	00:56:49.040	00:56:52.020	percentage of land value in the course of a year.
884	00:56:52.030	00:56:55.470	That has a very destabilizing effect, and circumstances change very
885	00:56:55.480	00:57:05.550	quickly. So the future of the country's biggest bank depends
886	00:57:05.560	00:57:09.210	in large part on the future of American agriculture. The
887	00:57:09.220	00:57:12.400	experts differ on what that future will be, but time
888	00:57:12.410	00:57:14.630	may not be on the side of the farmers of
889	00:57:14.640	00:57:19.900	Creston, Iowa, or the Farm Credit System. As we reported,
890	00:57:19.910	00:57:22.790	time has now run out for the Farm Credit System.
891	00:57:22.800	00:57:26.120	Tomorrow the system's board of governors is expected to announce
892	00:57:26.130	00:57:29.790	its recommendations to resolve the credit crunch. As far as
893	00:57:29.800	00:57:32.760	getting more aid, that tough political step will be up
894	00:57:32.770	00:57:37.270	to the administration and Congress. Robin? Once again, the main
895	00:57:37.280	00:57:41.240	stories of the day. Moscow threatened to deploy anti-satellite weapons
896	00:57:41.250	00:57:44.780	in space. The Farm Credit Administration, as we've just said,
897	00:57:44.790	00:57:48.540	said it needs financial help. South Africa's currency, the rand,
898	00:57:48.550	00:57:52.920	fell sharply. Delta Airlines filed a suit blaming air controllers
