1	00:01:10.650	00:01:13.600	Good evening. I'm Jim Lehrer. On the NewsHour tonight: Our
2	00:01:13.610	00:01:16.450	summary of the news; then, a three-part look at the
3	00:01:16.460	00:01:20.720	escalating violence in Iraq--a report from Iraq by Jeffrey
4	00:01:20.730	00:01:24.040	Gettleman of the "New York Times," analysis of the Shiite
5	00:01:24.050	00:01:26.960	group and its leader that triggered some of the weekend
6	00:01:26.970	00:01:31.650	attacks, and reaction from Senate Foreign Relations Committee leaders, Senators
7	00:01:31.660	00:01:35.070	Lugar and Biden. We close with some thoughts about how
8	00:01:35.080	00:01:38.690	the steroids scandal is touching the new Major League Baseball
9	00:01:38.700	00:03:02.820	season. U.S.-Led forces struck back on several fronts against the
10	00:03:02.830	00:03:07.520	armed resistance in Iraq today. In Baghdad, U.S. Apache helicopters
11	00:03:07.530	00:03:12.650	fired into a Shiite Muslim neighborhood after receiving small-arms fire.
12	00:03:12.660	00:03:16.740	Troops stepped up patrols there and in another Shiite area,
13	00:03:16.750	00:03:19.600	where fierce fighting killed eight U.S. troops and at least
14	00:03:19.610	00:03:24.010	52 Iraqis this weekend. In all, 12 American troops were
15	00:03:24.020	00:03:28.360	killed in the last 24 hours. Also in Baghdad, U.S.
16	00:03:28.370	00:03:32.520	officials branded a radical Shiite cleric an "outlaw," and announced
17	00:03:32.530	00:03:34.840	a warrant for his arrest for the murder of a
18	00:03:34.850	00:03:40.220	rival cleric last year. Moqtada al-Sadr implored his followers to
19	00:03:40.230	00:03:45.090	stage the recent Shiite protests against the U.S. occupation. A
20	00:03:45.100	00:03:51.200	U.S. Military spokesman said al-Sadr's militia threatens the country's stability.
21	00:03:51.210	00:03:54.780	We will take action, as and when necessary, to maintain
22	00:03:54.790	00:04:02.170	a safe and secure environment in Iraq. Individuals who create
23	00:04:02.180	00:04:07.100	violence, who incite violence, who execute violence against persons inside
24	00:04:07.110	00:04:11.630	of Iraq will be hunted down and captured or killed.
25	00:04:11.640	00:04:15.840	It is that simple. In southern Iraq, Shiite protestors demanded
26	00:04:15.850	00:04:21.290	the release of al-Sadr's imprisoned supporters. British troops exchanged gunfire
27	00:04:21.300	00:04:25.520	with militiamen who seized the governor's office. And northwest of
28	00:04:25.530	00:04:30.140	Baghdad, hundreds of U.S. Marines and Iraqi troops launched operation
29	00:04:30.150	00:04:34.290	vigilant resolve in the city of Fallujah. They closed roads
30	00:04:34.300	00:04:38.960	and imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew. U.S. commanders vowed to subdue
31	00:04:38.970	00:04:43.250	the city after insurgents and rioters killed and then mutilated
32	00:04:43.260	00:04:48.080	four American contractors there last week. President Bush said today
33	00:04:48.090	00:04:51.120	the United States would stick to a June 30 power
34	00:04:51.130	00:04:55.320	transfer in Iraq, despite the new violence. He told reporters
35	00:04:55.330	00:04:58.350	in North Carolina the U.S. had an obligation to do
36	00:04:58.360	00:05:01.630	so. The message to the Iraqi citizens is they don't
37	00:05:01.640	00:05:05.420	have to fear that America will turn and run. That's
38	00:05:05.430	00:05:07.280	an important message for them to hear. They think that
39	00:05:07.290	00:05:10.740	we're not sincere about staying the course. Many people will
40	00:05:10.750	00:05:13.600	not continue to take a risk toward, take the risk
41	00:05:13.610	00:05:16.860	toward freedom and democracy. The president said the U.S. would
42	00:05:16.870	00:05:20.850	maintain a very strong military presence in Iraq after the
43	00:05:20.860	00:05:24.310	handover. We'll have more on the Iraq violence story right
44	00:05:24.320	00:05:28.730	after this News Summary. Spanish authorities today announced two more
45	00:05:28.740	00:05:32.620	arrests in the Madrid train bombings. They were made Saturday,
46	00:05:32.630	00:05:36.260	the same day at least four other suspects blew themselves
47	00:05:36.270	00:05:40.070	up rather than surrender to police in Madrid. Three of
48	00:05:40.080	00:05:43.510	those killed have been linked to the bombings. The alleged
49	00:05:43.520	00:05:47.090	mastermind was among them. At least 16 people are being
50	00:05:47.100	00:05:51.600	held in the March 11 bombing that killed 191 people,
51	00:05:51.610	00:05:56.260	injured some 1,800. Secretary of State Powell was in Haiti
52	00:05:56.270	00:06:00.400	today. It was his first visit since former President Aristide
53	00:06:00.410	00:06:04.510	went into exile. Powell urged the country's new prime minister
54	00:06:04.520	00:06:07.780	to deny government posts to leaders of the rebellion that
55	00:06:07.790	00:06:11.690	put him in power, especially those with criminal records. Gerard
56	00:06:11.700	00:06:16.290	Latortue was appointed head of state after a week's-long popular
57	00:06:16.300	00:06:21.510	insurrection. He later hailed some rebel leaders as freedom fighters.
58	00:06:21.520	00:06:24.810	The sweeping power failure in eight states and Canada last
59	00:06:24.820	00:06:28.040	summer could happen again. That was the conclusion of a
60	00:06:28.050	00:06:33.100	final report issued today by a joint Canadian-American taskforce. It
61	00:06:33.110	00:06:36.430	blamed the power industry for failing to follow its voluntary
62	00:06:36.440	00:06:40.540	rules to ensure the reliable flow of electricity. And it
63	00:06:40.550	00:06:44.610	said power companies needed to have mandatory standards, and strong
64	00:06:44.620	00:06:48.750	enforcement of them. A flash flood killed at least 25
65	00:06:48.760	00:06:53.160	people in northern Mexico today. Rescue helicopters searched for 60
66	00:06:53.170	00:06:57.090	more missing residents in the border town of Piedras Negras,
67	00:06:57.100	00:07:01.530	150 miles southwest of San Antonio, Texas. Flooding in the
68	00:07:01.540	00:07:05.700	region began yesterday, when thunderstorms dumped up to two feet
69	00:07:05.710	00:07:10.720	of rain in parts of Mexico, Texas and New Mexico.
70	00:07:10.730	00:07:15.250	The Pulitzer Prizes for 2004 were announced today. In journalism,
71	00:07:15.260	00:07:18.540	the "Los Angeles Times" won in five categories, including for
72	00:07:18.550	00:07:23.770	its coverage of Southern California's wildfires last fall. The investigative
73	00:07:23.780	00:07:26.760	reporting prize went to "The Blade" of Toledo, Ohio, for
74	00:07:26.770	00:07:29.380	its investigative series on atrocities by the elite U.S. Army
75	00:07:29.390	00:07:32.980	unit, tiger force, during the Vietnam War. That series was
76	00:07:32.990	00:07:36.250	featured on the NewsHour last Friday. In the arts, the
77	00:07:36.260	00:07:39.600	biography winner was William Taubman for his book about Russian
78	00:07:39.610	00:07:43.990	leader Nikita Khrushchev. General nonfiction went to Anne Applebaum for
79	00:07:44.000	00:07:47.590	her history of the Soviet gulags. Edward P. Jones won
80	00:07:47.600	00:07:50.130	the fiction category for "The Known World," a novel about
81	00:07:50.140	00:07:54.210	slavery, Franz Wright, the poetry prize for "Walking to Martha's
82	00:07:54.220	00:07:59.920	Vineyard," Paul Moravec, the music prize for his "Tempest Fantasy,"
83	00:07:59.930	00:08:03.170	and for drama, Doug Wright for "I Am My Own
84	00:08:03.180	00:08:08.200	Wife." J.C. Penney sold its Eckerd drug store chain for
85	00:08:08.210	00:08:13.550	more than $4.5 billion today. The U.S.-based CVS Corporation and
86	00:08:13.560	00:08:17.610	a Canadian partner bought the chain of 2,800 Eckerd outlets
87	00:08:17.620	00:08:21.690	in 23 states. The deal makes CVS the largest drug
88	00:08:21.700	00:08:26.200	chain in the United States, with 5,000 stores. Bank of
89	00:08:26.210	00:08:30.010	America will cut 12,500 jobs, or 7 percent, of its
90	00:08:30.020	00:08:34.130	workforce. The announcement today follows completion of the bank's merger
91	00:08:34.140	00:08:37.550	with the Fleet Boston Financial Corporation. The bank said it
92	00:08:37.560	00:08:43.140	was trimming overlapping processes to save $650 million. It promised
93	00:08:43.150	00:08:47.220	customers no reduction in services. On Wall Street today, the
94	00:08:47.230	00:08:50.550	Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 87 points to
95	00:08:50.560	00:08:55.550	close at 10,558. The NASDAQ rose nearly 22 points to
96	00:08:55.560	00:09:00.070	close at 2079. That's it for the News Summary tonight.
97	00:09:00.080	00:09:02.230	Now it's on to our three-part look at the violence
98	00:09:02.240	00:09:16.980	in Iraq, and the opening of baseball's steroids season. The
99	00:09:16.990	00:09:20.330	new turmoil in Iraq. Part one: From on the ground,
100	00:09:20.340	00:09:26.570	and to Margaret Warner. The violence that killed eight American
101	00:09:26.580	00:09:30.440	soldiers and wounded more than three dozen yesterday, began with
102	00:09:30.450	00:09:35.570	Shiite protests in several Iraqi cities. The protests turned particularly
103	00:09:35.580	00:09:40.110	violent in the holy city of Najaf, and in Baghdad.
104	00:09:40.120	00:09:43.780	The fiercest fighting was in Baghdad's largest Shiite neighborhood, known
105	00:09:43.790	00:09:48.090	as Sadr City. It was there that the eight American
106	00:09:48.100	00:09:52.250	soldiers were killed. Overall, about 50 Iraqis were killed and
107	00:09:52.260	00:09:57.300	some 170 others wounded. The demonstrations throughout the country were
108	00:09:57.310	00:10:02.300	spearheaded by militant followers of a 31-year-old radical Islamic cleric,
109	00:10:02.310	00:10:09.230	Moqtada al-Sadr. Yesterday's clashes followed protests last week over the
110	00:10:09.240	00:10:14.120	coalition's decision to shut down al-Sadr's newspaper, and the Saturday
111	00:10:14.130	00:10:17.640	arrest of a top al-Sadr aide for alleged involvement in
112	00:10:17.650	00:10:21.010	the murder of a rival cleric last year. Today, the
113	00:10:21.020	00:10:25.580	U.S. Administrator in Iraq, Paul Bremer, declared al-Sadr an outlaw.
114	00:10:25.590	00:10:30.830	He is effectively attempting to establish his authority in place
115	00:10:30.840	00:10:35.350	of the legitimate authority of the Iraqi government and the
116	00:10:35.360	00:10:41.700	coalition. And as I said yesterday, we will not tolerate
117	00:10:41.710	00:10:50.170	this. We will reassert the law and order which the
118	00:10:50.180	00:10:56.180	Iraqi people expect of the coalition and the Iraqi forces.
119	00:10:56.190	00:10:59.960	Coalition authorities also disclosed today that an Iraqi judge had
120	00:10:59.970	00:11:03.400	issued an arrest warrant for al-Sadr several months ago in
121	00:11:03.410	00:11:07.690	connection with the rival cleric's murder. Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt
122	00:11:07.700	00:11:11.930	said the violence incited by al-Sadr's militia, the Amahdi army,
123	00:11:11.940	00:11:16.480	and other militias would not be tolerated. Militias are inconsistent
124	00:11:16.490	00:11:20.470	with a democratic and sovereign nation with a central government.
125	00:11:20.480	00:11:23.880	And we will take action, as and when necessary, to
126	00:11:23.890	00:11:31.420	maintain a safe and secure environment in Iraq. Individuals who
127	00:11:31.430	00:11:36.190	create violence, who incite violence, who execute violence against persons
128	00:11:36.200	00:11:39.930	inside of Iraq will be hunted down and captured or
129	00:11:39.940	00:11:45.270	killed. It is that simple. Despite a show of force
130	00:11:45.280	00:11:49.000	by coalition troops, new Shiite protests led by members of
131	00:11:49.010	00:11:54.330	al-Sadr's Amahdi militia erupted today in several Iraqi cities. And
132	00:11:54.340	00:11:57.760	for the latest developments inside Iraq, we're joined from Baghdad
133	00:11:57.770	00:12:01.280	by Jeffrey Gettleman of the "New York Times." Jeffrey, welcome.
134	00:12:01.290	00:12:03.340	I gather you've been in a lot of these hot
135	00:12:03.350	00:12:05.980	spots today. Give us a feeling for what it's like
136	00:12:05.990	00:12:09.890	on the ground. Sure. Today I went to two places.
137	00:12:09.900	00:12:13.880	I went to Fallujah in western Iraq, where right now
138	00:12:13.890	00:12:19.510	the marines are dealing with an insurgency by Sunni Muslims.
139	00:12:19.520	00:12:22.380	There was this horrible incident last week, where four people
140	00:12:22.390	00:12:25.450	were killed, four American civilians were killed in the center
141	00:12:25.460	00:12:28.770	of Fallujah, and their bodies were dragged through the streets.
142	00:12:28.780	00:12:32.290	And today, the marines began to surround the city and
143	00:12:32.300	00:12:35.880	plan a siege to find the people who were responsible
144	00:12:35.890	00:12:38.540	for this attack, and try to restore some order in
145	00:12:38.550	00:12:40.970	Fallujah. I did that today. And I also went to
146	00:12:40.980	00:12:43.670	a city called Kufa in the South, which has been
147	00:12:43.680	00:12:49.390	racked by violence where militiamen loyal to a Shia cleric
148	00:12:49.400	00:12:52.910	have taken over the town, kicked off the Iraqi police,
149	00:12:52.920	00:12:57.210	and established their own occupation-free zone in the area where
150	00:12:57.220	00:13:01.910	there's no coalition or occupation authorities, no Iraqi police, only
151	00:13:01.920	00:13:05.010	these members of this militia who wear all black, carry
152	00:13:05.020	00:13:08.750	machine guns and sort of rule the town as it
153	00:13:08.760	00:13:12.100	is right now. And are they very much in evidence?
154	00:13:12.110	00:13:13.740	Yeah, they are. They're all over the place. I mean,
155	00:13:13.750	00:13:18.500	what's going on is this one cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr, is
156	00:13:18.510	00:13:21.010	in a mosque right now, and he's refusing to come
157	00:13:21.020	00:13:24.460	out. The coalition authorities have issued an arrest warrant for
158	00:13:24.470	00:13:28.310	him because they say he's been behind this recent upsurgence
159	00:13:28.320	00:13:31.220	in violence, and also that he had played a part
160	00:13:31.230	00:13:35.510	in an assassination attempt or an assassination last year. So
161	00:13:35.520	00:13:39.410	his followers have surrounded his mosque. They have a lot
162	00:13:39.420	00:13:43.350	of guns, RPG's, which are rocket-propelled grenades, and they say
163	00:13:43.360	00:13:46.460	that they're preparing for a siege by American forces when
164	00:13:46.470	00:13:51.030	they come to take this cleric, Moqtada al-Sadr. Tell us
165	00:13:51.040	00:13:54.270	a little more about yesterday. I mean, was al-Sadr able
166	00:13:54.280	00:13:57.090	to just give the word and suddenly all these protests
167	00:13:57.100	00:14:00.710	erupted in all these different cities? Yesterday was really scary.
168	00:14:00.720	00:14:02.520	It was the first time since I've been here--I've
169	00:14:02.530	00:14:05.090	been here about three months--that there were really signs
170	00:14:05.100	00:14:08.220	that things were slipping out of control. The day began
171	00:14:08.230	00:14:13.610	with massive demonstrations in many cities across Iraq, in Baghdad,
172	00:14:13.620	00:14:17.140	in Najaf, Basra and a few other places. And they
173	00:14:17.150	00:14:21.070	were organized by this cleric, al-Sadr, who is protesting two
174	00:14:21.080	00:14:24.720	things, basically. One is the Americans shut down his newspaper
175	00:14:24.730	00:14:29.230	last week. He publishes a weekly newspaper, the American authorities
176	00:14:29.240	00:14:32.390	had accused it of printing lies that incited violence, and
177	00:14:32.400	00:14:35.530	so they took action last week and closed the newspaper.
178	00:14:35.540	00:14:39.130	That began the series of protests starting last week, that
179	00:14:39.140	00:14:42.530	sort of built to through this past week. The second
180	00:14:42.540	00:14:46.100	event was the arrest of one of al-Sadr's aides, who
181	00:14:46.110	00:14:50.790	supposedly was linked to an assassination of a rival cleric
182	00:14:50.800	00:14:54.820	last year. So there was a lot of energy in
183	00:14:54.830	00:14:58.690	the street. This cleric, al-Sadr, was calling for his followers
184	00:14:58.700	00:15:01.860	to protest these two things. Meanwhile, many of them are
185	00:15:01.870	00:15:04.820	armed. And as the day went on yesterday, things got
186	00:15:04.830	00:15:07.650	out of control. It started with stones being tossed in
187	00:15:07.660	00:15:10.850	a few places, then there were gunshots, and then just
188	00:15:10.860	00:15:14.360	sort of all-out mayhem erupted both here in Baghdad and
189	00:15:14.370	00:15:18.260	in a few other places. How seriously have the U.S.
190	00:15:18.270	00:15:21.810	forces and U.S. officials that you've talked to taken al-Sadr
191	00:15:21.820	00:15:25.280	up till now, in terms of whether he has a
192	00:15:25.290	00:15:29.770	big enough following, how powerful this militia of his is?
193	00:15:29.780	00:15:32.610	I think the U.S. authorities have been watching him, as
194	00:15:32.620	00:15:35.620	evidenced by shutting down his newspaper last week. They said
195	00:15:35.630	00:15:38.650	that was a very difficult decision because they anticipated that
196	00:15:38.660	00:15:41.790	it would provoke many of his followers to demonstrate in
197	00:15:41.800	00:15:44.150	the streets, but they were very worried that if he
198	00:15:44.160	00:15:47.980	continued to print this newspaper that contained lies according to
199	00:15:47.990	00:15:53.220	the coalition. One example was that al-Sadr had accused the
200	00:15:53.230	00:15:56.200	coalition of planning a suicide bombing or an attack against
201	00:15:56.210	00:15:59.170	the police station that everybody else here in Iraq had
202	00:15:59.180	00:16:01.870	basically thought was a suicide bombing. But they thought that
203	00:16:01.880	00:16:04.890	if this paper continued it could really cause a problem.
204	00:16:04.900	00:16:07.070	So they had been watching him, but I think more
205	00:16:07.080	00:16:11.250	of the focus been on another Shiite cleric, Ayatollah Sistani,
206	00:16:11.260	00:16:13.860	who is a much older man, he lives in Najaf,
207	00:16:13.870	00:16:17.430	he issues these religious decrees. And Sistani was playing a
208	00:16:17.440	00:16:21.060	much more active role in the governance of Iraq. So
209	00:16:21.070	00:16:24.060	while there was a lot of focus on Sistani, Sadr
210	00:16:24.070	00:16:26.720	was able to sort of create a following, build a
211	00:16:26.730	00:16:29.580	militia, and yesterday we saw the results of that. Now,
212	00:16:29.590	00:16:33.500	what do coalition officials say about, or how do they
213	00:16:33.510	00:16:36.950	explain the fact that this arrest warrant apparently, which was
214	00:16:36.960	00:16:40.070	disclosed today was issued for him months ago, but they've
215	00:16:40.080	00:16:43.820	never arrested him? You know, they really didn't address that
216	00:16:43.830	00:16:46.690	question. It came up, but there was no clear answer
217	00:16:46.700	00:16:49.780	why if the arrest warrant had been issued months ago
218	00:16:49.790	00:16:53.600	it was just coming out today, one day after al-Sadr
219	00:16:53.610	00:16:57.680	had provoked what proved to be the greatest insurrection since
220	00:16:57.690	00:17:02.980	occupation began. And U.S. officials--and we've run some of
221	00:17:02.990	00:17:05.860	this tape--had some very tough talk about how they
222	00:17:05.870	00:17:07.880	plan to crack down on these militias, they're not going
223	00:17:07.890	00:17:11.950	to tolerate them. Anybody who is involved will be put
224	00:17:11.960	00:17:15.030	out of business, and so on. What is their plan,
225	00:17:15.040	00:17:18.560	really, for cracking down on all of these? It's really
226	00:17:18.570	00:17:21.770	not clear. And like my visit to Kufa today showed,
227	00:17:21.780	00:17:23.940	it's going to be a serious challenge. I mean, the
228	00:17:23.950	00:17:26.930	town of Kufa, it's a small town along the banks
229	00:17:26.940	00:17:30.320	of the Euphrates River, it's actually quite pretty, the river
230	00:17:30.330	00:17:32.620	runs right through it, there are these palm trees lining
231	00:17:32.630	00:17:35.260	each side, and there's this beautiful mosque in the middle.
232	00:17:35.270	00:17:38.680	That's where al-Sadr is holed up right now. But he
233	00:17:38.690	00:17:42.480	has the place so surrounded with his followers, who are
234	00:17:42.490	00:17:45.250	so loyal to him, and almost fanatical. You see them
235	00:17:45.260	00:17:48.300	marching through the streets with these huge posters of al-Sadr,
236	00:17:48.310	00:17:50.810	chanting his name. They all say that they'll die for
237	00:17:50.820	00:17:54.220	him, and they've really dug in. So to uproot a
238	00:17:54.230	00:17:57.860	militia like that, it's going to be mayhem. And there's
239	00:17:57.870	00:18:00.250	a lot of people in Kufa today that I talked
240	00:18:00.260	00:18:03.150	to that are sort of dreading what may happen if
241	00:18:03.160	00:18:05.430	the U.S. troops come down there, or any troops come
242	00:18:05.440	00:18:08.870	down there to try to take him out because they're
243	00:18:08.880	00:18:11.620	so entrenched right now and the support for him is
244	00:18:11.630	00:18:15.510	so loyal right there, that it's hard to imagine how
245	00:18:15.520	00:18:18.930	this is going to be resolved without some serious fighting.
246	00:18:18.940	00:18:21.530	And do U.S. Officials or coalition officials you talked to
247	00:18:21.540	00:18:24.130	say they think they've got enough troops to handle all
248	00:18:24.140	00:18:26.760	of this? Well, that's one of those questions that keeps
249	00:18:26.770	00:18:28.860	coming up, and we keep getting the same answer. And
250	00:18:28.870	00:18:30.840	that is yes, we do have enough troops to handle
251	00:18:30.850	00:18:35.850	this. But part of that explanation was based on reassurances
252	00:18:35.860	00:18:39.810	given by American authorities that the Iraqi police forces and
253	00:18:39.820	00:18:42.960	security forces were ready to take on some of the
254	00:18:42.970	00:18:46.780	day-to-day security. But what was really frightening about yesterday was
255	00:18:46.790	00:18:50.220	that the Iraqi forces just collapsed, and Sadr City, where
256	00:18:50.230	00:18:53.880	there was serious fighting going on, the Iraqi police fled
257	00:18:53.890	00:18:57.880	and the Americans had to come in and battle these
258	00:18:57.890	00:19:00.080	forces loyal to Sadr to get them out of the
259	00:19:00.090	00:19:03.330	police stations they seized. In Kufa, there wasn't even a
260	00:19:03.340	00:19:06.350	battle. As soon as the armed militia arrived at the
261	00:19:06.360	00:19:10.870	doorsteps of the police station, the police left. So that
262	00:19:10.880	00:19:13.410	seems to raise the question of how ready are the
263	00:19:13.420	00:19:17.070	Iraqis right now to provide for their own security if
264	00:19:17.080	00:19:19.930	there is a handover and the American forces play more
265	00:19:19.940	00:19:23.830	of a secondary role. Jeffrey Gettleman, thanks so much. Thank
266	00:19:23.840	00:19:28.760	you. Now, part two: More on the Shia leader, and
267	00:19:28.770	00:19:33.130	to Gwen Ifill, For more about the latest Shiite uprising,
268	00:19:33.140	00:19:35.830	and what it means for the continuing occupation, we turn
269	00:19:35.840	00:19:39.030	to Samer Shehata, a visiting assistant professor of Middle East
270	00:19:39.040	00:19:42.900	politics at the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies at Georgetown
271	00:19:42.910	00:19:47.730	University; and Adeed Dawisha, professor of political science at Miami
272	00:19:47.740	00:19:51.360	University of Ohio--he's written extensively on the politics of
273	00:19:51.370	00:19:55.090	the Middle East. Professor Shehata, we've heard about the general
274	00:19:55.100	00:19:59.380	reluctance of the Shia population to this occupation and to
275	00:19:59.390	00:20:02.900	the legal steps which are being put in place to,
276	00:20:02.910	00:20:06.450	for the handover on June 30. What do we see
277	00:20:06.460	00:20:09.820	over the weekend with this new uprising that tells us
278	00:20:09.830	00:20:12.410	what effect that will have on the prospects for the
279	00:20:12.420	00:20:16.750	handover? Well, what we've seen is a Shia leader who
280	00:20:16.760	00:20:19.310	has been the most vehement in his criticism of the
281	00:20:19.320	00:20:23.620	occupation in his calling into question the legitimacy of the
282	00:20:23.630	00:20:27.860	Iraqi governing council, someone who's been excluded from the political
283	00:20:27.870	00:20:32.040	process--not easily willing to go way or to succumb
284	00:20:32.050	00:20:37.010	to the rule of the coalition provisional authority. It's not
285	00:20:37.020	00:20:41.040	clear how powerful Sadr is, it's not clear how many
286	00:20:41.050	00:20:44.840	people are in his militia as it were. But these
287	00:20:44.850	00:20:47.330	are the types of difficulties that the CPA is going
288	00:20:47.340	00:20:49.260	to face in the future because this isn't the only
289	00:20:49.270	00:20:53.610	militia, it's not the only Islamist based militia either. He
290	00:20:53.620	00:20:57.910	is 30 years old, relatively new to any positions of
291	00:20:57.920	00:21:01.180	leadership. But is he someone that the United States or
292	00:21:01.190	00:21:05.620	the coalition provisional authority has been taking seriously? Not really.
293	00:21:05.630	00:21:07.590	He is young, there's no question about that, and he's
294	00:21:07.600	00:21:11.910	also politically inexperienced, which is not a very good combination.
295	00:21:11.920	00:21:15.110	But he comes from a long lineage of Shia clerics
296	00:21:15.120	00:21:19.920	who have a significant amount of standing in Iraq. His
297	00:21:19.930	00:21:23.130	father was of course killed by Saddam Hussein or Saddam
298	00:21:23.140	00:21:28.760	Hussein's agents, as well as two of Sadr's brothers. His
299	00:21:28.770	00:21:31.030	father was also in prison for some time and has
300	00:21:31.040	00:21:36.670	established a charitable network of welfare, education and other organizations
301	00:21:36.680	00:21:40.070	that have real resonance in the kind of disenfranchised Shia
302	00:21:40.080	00:21:43.900	community of Baghdad and beyond. But the United States has
303	00:21:43.910	00:21:48.410	not been taking Sadr very seriously. Adeed Dawisha, should they
304	00:21:48.420	00:21:52.880	have been taking him seriously? Well, it depends on what
305	00:21:52.890	00:21:56.410	you mean by taking him seriously. They've been eying him
306	00:21:56.420	00:22:00.770	very closely, and last fall, for example, when some of
307	00:22:00.780	00:22:05.580	his people ambushed an American group and killed two or
308	00:22:05.590	00:22:10.420	three Americans, the CPA actually went in and threatened him
309	00:22:10.430	00:22:13.770	with imprisonment, and as a result of that in fact
310	00:22:13.780	00:22:17.180	you find that for about September, October, up until very
311	00:22:17.190	00:22:20.810	recently about a month ago his rhetoric had been toned
312	00:22:20.820	00:22:24.140	down considerably. It's only in the last two or three
313	00:22:24.150	00:22:26.790	weeks that he's kind of upped the ante again and
314	00:22:26.800	00:22:31.230	began calling for violence against the Americans and insurrection, and
315	00:22:31.240	00:22:36.060	that's when the Americans began to do something about it,
316	00:22:36.070	00:22:38.790	or at least in a sense it began with closing
317	00:22:38.800	00:22:47.510	down his newspaper, and imprisoning his main lieutenant. Why the
318	00:22:47.520	00:22:50.980	suddenly stepped up rhetoric? What was it that triggered that
319	00:22:50.990	00:22:54.710	which led to this? You know, it's very difficult to
320	00:22:54.720	00:22:58.040	know why. I think that a lot of these groups,
321	00:22:58.050	00:23:01.180	including his are now jockeying for power in anticipation of
322	00:23:01.190	00:23:04.550	the transfer of power that the CPA is going to
323	00:23:04.560	00:23:08.850	be doing, and in June. It also probably is a
324	00:23:08.860	00:23:11.610	result of what's been happening in Fallujah, which has been
325	00:23:11.620	00:23:15.530	creating an image of the Americans as being somewhat weak,
326	00:23:15.540	00:23:19.820	unable to quell the insurrection in a town like Fallujah,
327	00:23:19.830	00:23:26.780	and with these people, especially the--Sadr and his group,
328	00:23:26.790	00:23:29.680	any sign of weakness is immediately pounced upon. So I
329	00:23:29.690	00:23:33.390	think that the events of the last month or so
330	00:23:33.400	00:23:37.520	have had a major impact on the change in strategy
331	00:23:37.530	00:23:41.600	of Sadr. And Professor Shehata, the events of the last
332	00:23:41.610	00:23:44.330	month or so have been all centered in the Sunni
333	00:23:44.340	00:23:51.000	Triangle--the only concerns about the Shia population had been
334	00:23:51.010	00:23:56.220	revolving around Ayatollah al-Sistani, who is obviously, what is his
335	00:23:56.230	00:23:59.930	relationship to al-Sadr, if any? Well, it's not a very
336	00:23:59.940	00:24:04.700	good one, it's a rival relationship really, over influence on
337	00:24:04.710	00:24:10.380	the Shia majority in Iraq. Although publicly, Sistani has not
338	00:24:10.390	00:24:15.890	said anything negatively against Sadr, Sadr has criticized al-Sistani and
339	00:24:15.900	00:24:20.450	other religious leaders in Iraq who have been willing to
340	00:24:20.460	00:24:23.630	engage in some kind of negotiations as it were with
341	00:24:23.640	00:24:26.590	the coalition provisional authority and the Americans. So they can
342	00:24:26.600	00:24:31.800	be seen as rival religious leaders, vying for the allegiance
343	00:24:31.810	00:24:35.310	of Iraq's Shia population. But rival on the same level?
344	00:24:35.320	00:24:38.690	Not at all, not on the same level. Sistani is
345	00:24:38.700	00:24:42.190	revered, he is a man of religious learning, a scholar,
346	00:24:42.200	00:24:45.720	he's reclusive; he's not somebody who has dirtied his hands
347	00:24:45.730	00:24:49.740	in the day-to-day politics of Iraq. Moqtada al-Sadr is the
348	00:24:49.750	00:24:53.430	opposite, he's young and inexperienced he has not had that
349	00:24:53.440	00:24:57.590	much religious learning whatsoever. And his main appeal is his
350	00:24:57.600	00:25:05.660	fiery anti-American, anti-occupation, nationalism really, a Shia nationalism that appeals
351	00:25:05.670	00:25:10.080	to the most disenfranchised elements of the population. Professor Dawisha,
352	00:25:10.090	00:25:13.630	Professor Shehata said he's not certain how many people that
353	00:25:13.640	00:25:17.960	Mr. Al-Sadr actually controls. Do you have a sense of
354	00:25:17.970	00:25:21.520	that, of who he's actually speaking to and whether it's
355	00:25:21.530	00:25:25.850	potent? Well, I agree that his main support comes from
356	00:25:25.860	00:25:30.470	the disenfranchised section of the Shiite community in Iraq, that's
357	00:25:30.480	00:25:33.970	why you find the demonstrations for example in Baghdad coming
358	00:25:33.980	00:25:36.540	out of Sadr City, which used to be called Saddam
359	00:25:36.550	00:25:41.040	City, which is the worst slums in Iraq--in Baghdad.
360	00:25:41.050	00:25:43.330	Now on the other side of the city, there is
361	00:25:43.340	00:25:47.240	an area which is also heavily Shiite, but this is
362	00:25:47.250	00:25:51.920	the area of middle class merchants, professionals and so on,
363	00:25:51.930	00:25:55.030	and so far nothing has come out of that area.
364	00:25:55.040	00:25:57.910	That tells you something about the kind of support he
365	00:25:57.920	00:26:02.240	has. In terms of militia, he controls, a militia called
366	00:26:02.250	00:26:07.020	a Mahdi army which is probably about 10,000 men. These
367	00:26:07.030	00:26:10.410	are all a bunch of, to be quite honest and
368	00:26:10.420	00:26:13.320	to say it plainly, a bunch of thugs who go
369	00:26:13.330	00:26:18.000	around these southern cities terrorizing women for not wearing the
370	00:26:18.010	00:26:24.210	right clothes, terrorizing professors who are probably secular; in fact
371	00:26:24.220	00:26:29.780	last week this Mahdi army went into a small village,
372	00:26:29.790	00:26:32.640	which is inhabited by gypsies and because the gypsies in
373	00:26:32.650	00:26:37.140	Iraq tend to kind of dance and sing, this village
374	00:26:37.150	00:26:41.130	was entirely raised to the ground, and it's inhabitants of
375	00:26:41.140	00:26:44.050	about a thousand or fifteen hundred were either killed or
376	00:26:44.060	00:26:47.290	tortured. This is the kind of group that this man
377	00:26:47.300	00:26:50.800	is presiding over. And this is why I think the
378	00:26:50.810	00:26:54.320	CPA has finally decided to take him on. Professor Shehata
379	00:26:54.330	00:26:56.790	if there are 10,000 of them and they are thugs
380	00:26:56.800	00:27:00.120	and they are organized thugs, what is it that the
381	00:27:00.130	00:27:02.990	coalition provisional authority ought to be doing or the United
382	00:27:03.000	00:27:06.600	States forces ought to be doing to silence them? Well,
383	00:27:06.610	00:27:09.450	this is the crucial question, because Moqtada al-Sadr might not
384	00:27:09.460	00:27:12.280	be a problem, but how the U.S. deals with him
385	00:27:12.290	00:27:15.880	and his militia is a crucial issue. I think that
386	00:27:15.890	00:27:18.050	dealing with them as they have over the last couple
387	00:27:18.060	00:27:21.280	of days with Apache helicopter gun ships, tanks and so
388	00:27:21.290	00:27:24.700	on, my not be the best way to do that,
389	00:27:24.710	00:27:29.070	because Moqtada al-Sadr could become a martyr. This could embitter
390	00:27:29.080	00:27:32.640	a much larger segment of the Iraqi population against the
391	00:27:32.650	00:27:35.280	United States. So I think that's really the key question.
392	00:27:35.290	00:27:38.340	And it's not clear at all why this arrest warrant
393	00:27:38.350	00:27:41.930	was issued right now if it-or why they're trying
394	00:27:41.940	00:27:44.150	to arrest him right now, if the arrest warrant was
395	00:27:44.160	00:27:47.630	issued sometime ago. So I think probably what's in the
396	00:27:47.640	00:27:52.500	CPA's minds is this June 30 deadline and the desire
397	00:27:52.510	00:27:55.610	to get rid of someone like Moqtada al-Sadr and the
398	00:27:55.620	00:27:59.290	possible danger that he poses before the symbolic handover of
399	00:27:59.300	00:28:03.430	power to a sovereign Iraqi authority. Professor Dawisha, your thoughts
400	00:28:03.440	00:28:06.540	on that, exactly what should the coalition provisional authority be
401	00:28:06.550	00:28:09.910	doing if anything if he is that serious a threat?
402	00:28:09.920	00:28:12.580	I think the CPA at the moment is walking a
403	00:28:12.590	00:28:16.290	very tight rope, and I hope they will come to
404	00:28:16.300	00:28:19.730	the right conclusions about what to do. On the one
405	00:28:19.740	00:28:25.510	hand, the kind of people al-Sadr leads and he himself,
406	00:28:25.520	00:28:27.670	they're not the kind of people who in a sense
407	00:28:27.680	00:28:31.200	understand compromise. Any compromise on the part of the CPA
408	00:28:31.210	00:28:34.190	is seen as a sign of weakness and will only
409	00:28:34.200	00:28:37.780	engender even more violence on their part. On the other
410	00:28:37.790	00:28:42.660	hand, if, I agree wholeheartedly with Professor Shehata, if you
411	00:28:42.670	00:28:46.800	make al-Sadr into a martyr, then whatever support he has
412	00:28:46.810	00:28:51.290	might overspill into the larger Shiite community, and then if
413	00:28:51.300	00:28:54.300	we're going to have--the a large segment of the
414	00:28:54.310	00:28:58.950	Shiite community against us as well as the Sunni Triangle,
415	00:28:58.960	00:29:01.680	then we are having a major problem on our hands.
416	00:29:01.690	00:29:03.600	So we need to use--sorry. But in your opinion,
417	00:29:03.610	00:29:06.300	should he be removed, is he a serious enough threat
418	00:29:06.310	00:29:07.750	or can he just be set to the side and
419	00:29:07.760	00:29:11.150	ignored? I think if we can remove him while at
420	00:29:11.160	00:29:16.840	the same time appealing to the grand ayatollah's Sistani--the
421	00:29:16.850	00:29:20.560	people who have a lot of influence amongst the larger
422	00:29:20.570	00:29:24.140	Shiite community, if we can bring them in and don't
423	00:29:24.150	00:29:28.150	forget these people detest Moqtada al-Sadr; they would be very
424	00:29:28.160	00:29:30.750	happy to see him go. If we can do this
425	00:29:30.760	00:29:34.660	kind of stick and carrot policy, then we might get
426	00:29:34.670	00:29:37.710	away with it. But if we just leave him untouched,
427	00:29:37.720	00:29:40.290	then he's just going to continue, because he's going to
428	00:29:40.300	00:29:42.370	see this as a sign of weakness on our part
429	00:29:42.380	00:29:45.100	and that's something which he plays on. Adeed Dawisha and
430	00:29:45.110	00:29:50.220	Samer Shehata, thank you for joining us. And now, part
431	00:29:50.230	00:29:53.280	three of our Iraq violence focus with the two leaders
432	00:29:53.290	00:29:56.740	of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: The chairman, Richard Lugar,
433	00:29:56.750	00:30:00.760	Republican of Indiana; and the ranking Democrat Joe Biden of
434	00:30:00.770	00:30:05.180	Delaware. Senator Lugar, the president today rejected delaying the June
435	00:30:05.190	00:30:08.780	or considering delaying the June 30 deadline for turning over
436	00:30:08.790	00:30:12.770	sovereignty to Iraq. Do you agree with him? Well, I
437	00:30:12.780	00:30:16.220	was asked a question yesterday by a reporter about the
438	00:30:16.230	00:30:20.020	30th deadline and it appeared to me that this might
439	00:30:20.030	00:30:23.100	be a subject for more study and more debate. And
440	00:30:23.110	00:30:27.030	certainly the program you've had this evening illustrates some of
441	00:30:27.040	00:30:31.560	the reasons why, namely the timeframe is very small to
442	00:30:31.570	00:30:35.590	disarm the militia, to bring about a security situation in
443	00:30:35.600	00:30:39.910	which the governing council, the 24 Iraqis or however many
444	00:30:39.920	00:30:44.640	others they appoint, can govern the country. And furthermore, I
445	00:30:44.650	00:30:48.280	added that over here on the Senate, at some point
446	00:30:48.290	00:30:51.750	we hope to see a nominee for ambassador of the
447	00:30:51.760	00:30:56.750	country, a very important appointment, and have the confirmation process,
448	00:30:56.760	00:30:59.820	learn more about the 3,000 Americans who may be going
449	00:30:59.830	00:31:03.280	to the largest embassy we've ever had before the 30th
450	00:31:03.290	00:31:06.780	of June and try to figure out the security for
451	00:31:06.790	00:31:10.790	those Americans quite apart from those folks who are out
452	00:31:10.800	00:31:15.360	there now: Humanitarian people, construction Americans, trying to help the
453	00:31:15.370	00:31:19.100	Iraqis rebuild their country. But Senator, it was your statement
454	00:31:19.110	00:31:22.040	that caused the president to be asked this very question
455	00:31:22.050	00:31:26.280	today. Yes. Do you interpret his answer as saying no
456	00:31:26.290	00:31:31.030	way, Senator Lugar? That's my impression. That the president gave
457	00:31:31.040	00:31:34.500	that answer, that June 30 is it, is the deadline.
458	00:31:34.510	00:31:37.540	Now if this be the case, then I'm very hopeful
459	00:31:37.550	00:31:41.770	that whoever is doing the planning for the next few
460	00:31:41.780	00:31:45.430	days as we count down to June 30, will come
461	00:31:45.440	00:31:48.580	forward, at least to some of us in the Congress,
462	00:31:48.590	00:31:53.070	I think that they probably in the administration will need
463	00:31:53.080	00:31:56.400	some of our assistance in a time in which the
464	00:31:56.410	00:31:59.840	Congress has been polarized, is fractious, as the president and
465	00:31:59.850	00:32:02.840	others have observed. We're going to need at least some
466	00:32:02.850	00:32:06.020	idea, which we used to get daily when the war
467	00:32:06.030	00:32:09.910	was going on, the hostilities in Iraq. But now whole
468	00:32:09.920	00:32:14.650	weeks pass without any sign really of how things are
469	00:32:14.660	00:32:17.300	proceeding. So we're going to have hearings in the Foreign
470	00:32:17.310	00:32:20.710	Relations Committee on the 20th, the 21st and 22nd of
471	00:32:20.720	00:32:24.230	this month, we are going to probe anybody who will
472	00:32:24.240	00:32:27.230	tell us what ought to occur in Iraq, or what
473	00:32:27.240	00:32:30.700	is occurring. Senator Biden, how do you read the president's
474	00:32:30.710	00:32:34.400	statement today, same way Senator Lugar does? The exact same
475	00:32:34.410	00:32:39.030	way Senator Lugar does, and quite frankly I think whether
476	00:32:39.040	00:32:42.000	or not we go forward on June 30 is actually
477	00:32:42.010	00:32:45.650	less important than whether we have a plan for success.
478	00:32:45.660	00:32:48.040	I don't know what the administration's plan is. I don't
479	00:32:48.050	00:32:50.450	know what the plan is as when Bremer says wheels
480	00:32:50.460	00:32:55.400	up on June 30, what happens then, to whom are
481	00:32:55.410	00:33:00.000	we turning over sovereignty, number one. Number two, who is
482	00:33:00.010	00:33:02.560	going to be the referee, there's no doubt there's going
483	00:33:02.570	00:33:05.760	to be some degree of chaos between June 30 and
484	00:33:05.770	00:33:07.450	the time general elections are to be held at the
485	00:33:07.460	00:33:10.120	end of January. Who is going to be the one
486	00:33:10.130	00:33:15.370	that lets, if in fact Chalabi makes a deal with
487	00:33:15.380	00:33:19.890	Sistani on diminishing the role of women in Iraq, for
488	00:33:19.900	00:33:23.620	example, who is going to démarche them just like we
489	00:33:23.630	00:33:27.610	did in Afghanistan when they-when the Loyah Jirga were
490	00:33:27.620	00:33:31.160	putting together their constitution and they diverted in a significant
491	00:33:31.170	00:33:33.650	way? I just don't know what the plan is, and
492	00:33:33.660	00:33:36.990	it is absolutely incredible to me that here we are
493	00:33:37.000	00:33:40.650	about twelve weeks out, neither the chairman of the Foreign
494	00:33:40.660	00:33:43.470	Relations Committee nor the ranking member, not that we're so
495	00:33:43.480	00:33:47.830	important, but institutionally we in a sense are, at least
496	00:33:47.840	00:33:50.510	I don't have any idea what their plan is. What
497	00:33:50.520	00:33:54.500	about the president's point today, Senator Biden, that the U.S.
498	00:33:54.510	00:33:58.480	has an obligation to the Iraqi people to keep its
499	00:33:58.490	00:34:00.770	word? The word was we're going to turn it over
500	00:34:00.780	00:34:03.450	on June 30. Yes, there's some security problems, yes the
501	00:34:03.460	00:34:06.350	U.S. is going to have to keep troops there. The
502	00:34:06.360	00:34:09.140	answer is there's some truth to that. The president for
503	00:34:09.150	00:34:14.690	whatever reason picking June 30 has raised expectations considerably. And
504	00:34:14.700	00:34:17.530	there's two concerns about not being able to turn power
505	00:34:17.540	00:34:20.860	over at that time: One would be that we have
506	00:34:20.870	00:34:25.120	reneged on our word to the Iraqi populace at large.
507	00:34:25.130	00:34:28.110	But the second is that is Sadr and his thugs
508	00:34:28.120	00:34:33.220	or the Sunni Triangle folks in Fallujah conclude that their
509	00:34:33.230	00:34:37.230	activity can alter our course of action--that they are
510	00:34:37.240	00:34:41.960	succeeding. So I acknowledge that there is a real concern.
511	00:34:41.970	00:34:45.030	There is still time to do this the right way,
512	00:34:45.040	00:34:48.090	in my view. But I just am at a loss
513	00:34:48.100	00:34:52.380	to be able to understand why there hasn't been a
514	00:34:52.390	00:34:56.140	resolution within the administration as to whether or not they're
515	00:34:56.150	00:34:58.580	going to go back for another U.N. resolution, whether or
516	00:34:58.590	00:35:01.250	not they're going to try to get a Brahimi-like figure
517	00:35:01.260	00:35:07.270	in--. The U.N. special--The U.N. special envoy, essentially a
518	00:35:07.280	00:35:12.060	high commissioner. In other words, I just don't know what
519	00:35:12.070	00:35:15.560	they have in mind. And as Dick said, during the
520	00:35:15.570	00:35:19.130	war, prior to the war they consulted with us regularly.
521	00:35:19.140	00:35:22.560	As if, and they're acting now like as if there's
522	00:35:22.570	00:35:24.840	no need to consult us, as if they don't need
523	00:35:24.850	00:35:30.700	congressional support. And I think it's less important that they
524	00:35:30.710	00:35:34.070	satisfy Dick and me than they satisfy the American people.
525	00:35:34.080	00:35:36.190	And I think the American people are beginning to wonder
526	00:35:36.200	00:35:38.490	whether they have a plan for success. Do you agree
527	00:35:38.500	00:35:40.620	with that, Senator Lugar, the American people are wondering what's
528	00:35:40.630	00:35:43.860	going on over there? Yes, they are wondering and we
529	00:35:43.870	00:35:50.010	need to offer answers. We meaning the entire U.S. Government,
530	00:35:50.020	00:35:52.060	you all included as well as the president? That's right-
531	00:35:52.070	00:35:54.990	the president and Congress. And we need to see it
532	00:35:55.000	00:35:58.340	together, so that it is even more credible. I would
533	00:35:58.350	00:36:01.240	just add to what Joe Biden has said that clearly
534	00:36:01.250	00:36:03.400	if I were a member of the governing council of
535	00:36:03.410	00:36:06.890	24 and sovereignty was passed to me, sometimes it's said
536	00:36:06.900	00:36:11.260	symbolically, but the Iraqis believe it's actually, and at that
537	00:36:11.270	00:36:15.400	point the Iraqis have virtually no army, the police forces
538	00:36:15.410	00:36:18.130	are very small and some are being trained as we've
539	00:36:18.140	00:36:22.040	just heard, they flee when there is conflict in the
540	00:36:22.050	00:36:24.080	cities of Iraq. If I were a member of that
541	00:36:24.090	00:36:26.360	governing council I would wonder how do I plan to
542	00:36:26.370	00:36:30.920	govern? The old idea is not to worry, the United
543	00:36:30.930	00:36:33.710	States will be there. But then the idea that we're
544	00:36:33.720	00:36:36.380	going to have an agreement with this new government prior
545	00:36:36.390	00:36:40.410	to June 30 has been put aside, and people have
546	00:36:40.420	00:36:43.480	said in Iraq, you can't do that prior to our
547	00:36:43.490	00:36:47.030	taking sovereignty. Then we'll make an arrangement with the United
548	00:36:47.040	00:36:52.220	States for the troops. This is an entirely unsatisfactory, watching
549	00:36:52.230	00:36:54.700	what we have been watching in the last few days.
550	00:36:54.710	00:36:57.590	Back to the rock and the hard place issue that
551	00:36:57.600	00:37:01.140	Senator Biden raised, that if the United States for whatever
552	00:37:01.150	00:37:04.860	reason does not meet its obligation or meet its promise
553	00:37:04.870	00:37:09.230	on June 30, then the al-Sadrs and the other thugs
554	00:37:09.240	00:37:13.360	in Iraq will have won. Is that a problem in
555	00:37:13.370	00:37:16.430	and of itself? Of course it's a problem. And I
556	00:37:16.440	00:37:20.540	would just say that talking about the June 30 deadline
557	00:37:20.550	00:37:24.530	is a difficult issue because of the promise that June
558	00:37:24.540	00:37:29.210	30 is it. But once again the Iraqi governing council
559	00:37:29.220	00:37:31.680	is the group that is to receive the sovereignty, they're
560	00:37:31.690	00:37:35.300	the group that supposedly will work out the road map
561	00:37:35.310	00:37:38.660	of how they get a constitution, how they have executive
562	00:37:38.670	00:37:42.370	persons there, how finally the elections might be held. And
563	00:37:42.380	00:37:44.360	in order to do any of that, they're going to
564	00:37:44.370	00:37:48.340	have to have some security around themselves. We're going to
565	00:37:48.350	00:37:53.040	transfer authority essentially from the Pentagon to the State Department
566	00:37:53.050	00:37:56.550	on June 30. Jerry Bremer leaves and an ambassador still
567	00:37:56.560	00:37:59.370	to be named and confirmed and all the people to
568	00:37:59.380	00:38:03.020	come in. This is a huge change in a very
569	00:38:03.030	00:38:06.970	insecure situation. And all I'm saying is that we do
570	00:38:06.980	00:38:09.330	need a road map of our own, that is the
571	00:38:09.340	00:38:13.860	congress, the American people, to follow what kind of sacrifice,
572	00:38:13.870	00:38:17.150	what kind of money, extra troops if that is required,
573	00:38:17.160	00:38:21.370	or whatever, so that we are successful. Senator Biden, extra
574	00:38:21.380	00:38:25.310	troops, that issue came up today in a joint press
575	00:38:25.320	00:38:31.400	availability in Baghdad with Paul Bremer, and they said that
576	00:38:31.410	00:38:34.900	no extra troops were needed, but always looking at that
577	00:38:34.910	00:38:37.100	as an issue. What do you think, where do you
578	00:38:37.110	00:38:40.430	come down on that? It's a very unpopular position I'm
579	00:38:40.440	00:38:42.570	taking, I've been taking it for the last five months,
580	00:38:42.580	00:38:45.810	we don't have enough troops there. The idea that you
581	00:38:45.820	00:38:48.420	hear Bremer and others and they're good people say that
582	00:38:48.430	00:38:54.390	we've trained up 200,000 Iraqi security forces from their civil
583	00:38:54.400	00:38:59.290	guard to their police to their army is absolutely preposterous.
584	00:38:59.300	00:39:01.450	When Dick Lugar and I were there over a year
585	00:39:01.460	00:39:04.400	ago almost now, we met with all our trainers, they
586	00:39:04.410	00:39:06.360	say it's going to take at least three years to
587	00:39:06.370	00:39:08.990	train up an Iraqi police force, it's going to take
588	00:39:09.000	00:39:11.810	that long or longer to train an Iraqi army. The
589	00:39:11.820	00:39:15.370	truth of the matter is there is no security but
590	00:39:15.380	00:39:18.970	U.S. security, a few Brits, a few Spaniards and a
591	00:39:18.980	00:39:23.210	few Poles. It is the United States of America. And
592	00:39:23.220	00:39:25.370	that's not going to change on June 30, right? It's
593	00:39:25.380	00:39:27.600	not going to change, it just going to get worse,
594	00:39:27.610	00:39:30.610	so we are the game, we are the totality of
595	00:39:30.620	00:39:36.130	the security. And it seems to me we're not leveling
596	00:39:36.140	00:39:40.060	with the American people here. This can be done, but
597	00:39:40.070	00:39:44.330	remember, we made the announcement as far back as late
598	00:39:44.340	00:39:48.010	November of last year to June 30 was the date.
599	00:39:48.020	00:39:51.930	Here we are, in April, and they still haven't resolved
600	00:39:51.940	00:39:55.170	the dispute in the administration between the State Department and
601	00:39:55.180	00:39:57.630	the vice president's office or who ever else is arguing
602	00:39:57.640	00:40:01.770	about this as to what is the plan. Senator Lugar,
603	00:40:01.780	00:40:04.960	is that the problem here, that the administration can't get
604	00:40:04.970	00:40:09.040	its own disagreements sorted out? I don't know; I frankly
605	00:40:09.050	00:40:14.280	don't know. I've asked this quietly, for a while, without
606	00:40:14.290	00:40:17.080	having any resolution of it. So as I've mentioned to
607	00:40:17.090	00:40:20.030	you publicly-we're going to raise these in a couple
608	00:40:20.040	00:40:23.150	of weeks and hopefully in that period of time the
609	00:40:23.160	00:40:27.210	administration will have plans that it can give to the
610	00:40:27.220	00:40:30.220	public and to us and then we can then move
611	00:40:30.230	00:40:33.190	more confidently. Do you agree with Senator Biden, he said
612	00:40:33.200	00:40:37.000	it twice now, that it can be done probably by
613	00:40:37.010	00:40:40.370	June 30? Yes, I think we need to focus on
614	00:40:40.380	00:40:45.200	success. The purpose of the conversation of Joe Biden and
615	00:40:45.210	00:40:47.800	Dick Lugar on these issues is that we have been
616	00:40:47.810	00:40:51.660	stalwarts in a bipartisan way for the president throughout this
617	00:40:51.670	00:40:55.170	entire period of time. We're not harping critics, attempting to
618	00:40:55.180	00:40:59.430	cause difficulty either publicly or privately. We want success, the
619	00:40:59.440	00:41:01.370	president wants success. We're going to have to begin to
620	00:41:01.380	00:41:04.410	pull together and talk to each other, and the American
621	00:41:04.420	00:41:07.610	people need to hear that conversation. Senator Biden, have you
622	00:41:07.620	00:41:10.650	made efforts to tell the people in the administration what
623	00:41:10.660	00:41:13.880	you all have just been saying here tonight? Absolutely I
624	00:41:13.890	00:41:15.730	have. As a matter of fact--. Who do you talk
625	00:41:15.740	00:41:20.040	to? Well, to Dr. Rice, I talked to the secretary
626	00:41:20.050	00:41:26.190	of state, and deputy secretary. But they're very empathetic and
627	00:41:26.200	00:41:29.380	sympathetic. I've tried to talk to the president. I came
628	00:41:29.390	00:41:33.170	back from a long meeting with President Chirac, meeting with
629	00:41:33.180	00:41:36.490	the heads of all our NATO allies, the so-called permanent
630	00:41:36.500	00:41:39.760	representatives in Brussels, I came back and I said this
631	00:41:39.770	00:41:42.240	is what, and I wrote a report, I asked for
632	00:41:42.250	00:41:44.520	five minutes to be able to see the president, he
633	00:41:44.530	00:41:47.120	was not able to see me. In the past, on
634	00:41:47.130	00:41:49.360	the run up to the war, Dick Lugar and I
635	00:41:49.370	00:41:52.640	and right after the war were in his office frequently.
636	00:41:52.650	00:41:54.470	I don't often ask to see the president of the
637	00:41:54.480	00:41:56.910	United States, it's not that I'm so important, I wanted
638	00:41:56.920	00:41:59.080	a report to the president on what was being said
639	00:41:59.090	00:42:02.380	in Europe, what possibilities existed in my view, so we
640	00:42:02.390	00:42:05.300	heard another point of view. And he wrote me a
641	00:42:05.310	00:42:08.790	very nice handwritten letter saying Condi will be in touch.
642	00:42:08.800	00:42:10.860	She called me and said I got your memo, got
643	00:42:10.870	00:42:15.080	your note, thank you very much. So now maybe you're
644	00:42:15.090	00:42:18.190	talking to somebody, Jim, look, Jim, if they have, if
645	00:42:18.200	00:42:21.740	there isn't a division within the administration, about what the
646	00:42:21.750	00:42:24.790	plan should be, then that means there is a plan
647	00:42:24.800	00:42:27.950	and they're not telling us. Why? I don't get it.
648	00:42:27.960	00:42:31.370	I mean, I truly do not get this. So, Senator
649	00:42:31.380	00:42:34.980	Lugar, same question. Have you been trying very hard also
650	00:42:34.990	00:42:36.830	to say the same thing and who have you been
651	00:42:36.840	00:42:40.030	talking to? Because it's unusual, both of you have said
652	00:42:40.040	00:42:43.720	it several times now, hey, you were definitely in the
653	00:42:43.730	00:42:46.140	loop up until recently, why are you no longer in
654	00:42:46.150	00:42:48.790	the loop, have you asked people that question? No, I've
655	00:42:48.800	00:42:54.050	not asked. My own supposition is essentially that there is
656	00:42:54.060	00:42:57.940	indecision right now as to the questions that we're raising
657	00:42:57.950	00:43:03.130	would be answered. And probably at least some inner circle
658	00:43:03.140	00:43:06.080	talk within the administration that they're not prepared really to
659	00:43:06.090	00:43:09.990	share, and as far as their concerned, essentially they would
660	00:43:10.000	00:43:14.070	say the administration is running this war or running the
661	00:43:14.080	00:43:18.350	peace, we are interesting people and in due course if
662	00:43:18.360	00:43:21.070	we can be brought together in some sort of alliance
663	00:43:21.080	00:43:23.610	that would be useful, but for the moment not a
664	00:43:23.620	00:43:38.170	priority. All right. Senators both, thank you very much. And
665	00:43:38.180	00:43:42.120	finally tonight, baseball begins a new season facing some tough
666	00:43:42.130	00:43:49.270	questions. Terence Smith has that. Into left center field. He's
667	00:43:49.280	00:43:53.630	going to...Baseball's new season got under way at ballparks
668	00:43:53.640	00:43:57.540	across the country today, with many fans and players braving
669	00:43:57.550	00:44:01.640	cold and windy weather. President Bush told reporters he had
670	00:44:01.650	00:44:04.960	a strategy for the ceremonial first pitch. I'm going straight
671	00:44:04.970	00:44:09.220	fastball today. Try to get a little hop on it.
672	00:44:09.230	00:44:11.520	And then later in St. Louis, he put his arm
673	00:44:11.530	00:44:16.400	to the test, and opened the Cardinals' season. This year,
674	00:44:16.410	00:44:20.820	the cloud of steroid use looms large over baseball. Last
675	00:44:20.830	00:44:26.750	season, nearly 1,200 ballplayers underwent anonymous, penalty-free testing for steroids
676	00:44:26.760	00:44:30.590	as part of the league's new drug policy. Between 5%
677	00:44:30.600	00:44:34.480	and 7% came back positive--enough to staff about three
678	00:44:34.490	00:44:39.280	teams. Baseball's drug policy is less stringent than other sports.
679	00:44:39.290	00:44:42.900	While a player can be fined and even temporarily suspended,
680	00:44:42.910	00:44:45.980	no player can be suspended for a full season until
681	00:44:45.990	00:44:51.860	his fifth offense. One San Francisco lab, Balco, is under
682	00:44:51.870	00:44:55.080	heavy scrutiny for its alleged role in a scheme to
683	00:44:55.090	00:45:00.500	distribute illegal steroids to professional athletes. Four people were indicted
684	00:45:00.510	00:45:04.150	by a federal grand jury, including Balco's founder and the
685	00:45:04.160	00:45:08.430	personal trainer to home run champion Barry Bonds. During the
686	00:45:08.440	00:45:11.660	offseason, President Bush raised the issue in his state of
687	00:45:11.670	00:45:14.830	the union address. And at a hearing in Washington last
688	00:45:14.840	00:45:18.640	month, Republican Senator John McCain put the pressure on Major
689	00:45:18.650	00:45:23.330	League players and owners to change their ways. Your failure
690	00:45:23.340	00:45:27.740	to commit to addressing this issue straight on, and immediately,
691	00:45:27.750	00:45:32.650	will motivate this committee to search for legislative remedies. I
692	00:45:32.660	00:45:36.430	don't know what they are, but I can tell you
693	00:45:36.440	00:45:40.640	and your players that you represent the status quo is
694	00:45:40.650	00:45:45.040	not acceptable. For his part, baseball commissioner Bud Selig has
695	00:45:45.050	00:45:49.670	acknowledged the problem in recent weeks, including yesterday on ABC's
696	00:45:49.680	00:45:54.570	"This Week." We need, in my opinion, is random testing
697	00:45:54.580	00:45:58.520	year round. We also need stiffer penalties. We need a
698	00:45:58.530	00:46:01.200	program, as I said earlier, like the one that's in
699	00:46:01.210	00:46:05.220	the minor leagues because that will forever remove the cloud.
700	00:46:05.230	00:46:07.840	George, this is not only a health issue. There's no
701	00:46:07.850	00:46:12.070	question about that. But it's also it's an integrity issue.
702	00:46:12.080	00:46:14.590	There's a whole series of things that we really have
703	00:46:14.600	00:46:17.800	to deal with. The players union has resisted calls for
704	00:46:17.810	00:46:24.590	random drug testing, citing concerns over the players' privacy. For
705	00:46:24.600	00:46:27.800	more, I'm joined by Buster Olney, a senior writer at
706	00:46:27.810	00:46:32.790	"ESPN," the magazine, and a longtime baseball beat reporter. Buster
707	00:46:32.800	00:46:37.500	Olney, welcome. Tell us, as this season opens, just how
708	00:46:37.510	00:46:41.160	widespread a problem is this? I mean, we mentioned those
709	00:46:41.170	00:46:45.550	tests last year that suggested five to seven percent. Is
710	00:46:45.560	00:46:49.020	that the dimension or is it in fact larger? I
711	00:46:49.030	00:46:51.740	think players think it's much larger than that. The five
712	00:46:51.750	00:46:55.870	to seven percent that tested positive last year, those were
713	00:46:55.880	00:46:58.230	tests that players could reasonably predict when they were going
714	00:46:58.240	00:47:00.410	to take place. I think when you talk to players
715	00:47:00.420	00:47:02.880	privately they think it's probably about a third of the
716	00:47:02.890	00:47:06.310	players, a couple years ago were taking it and maybe
717	00:47:06.320	00:47:08.600	half of those because they're feeling pressure to keep up
718	00:47:08.610	00:47:11.640	with their competitors. What does that do to baseball, if
719	00:47:11.650	00:47:15.250	that's the case, then it really is very widespread and
720	00:47:15.260	00:47:18.330	as Commissioner Selig said, it's on one hand a health
721	00:47:18.340	00:47:20.780	issue and on the other hand an integrity of the
722	00:47:20.790	00:47:25.150	game issue. What does that do to baseball? It really
723	00:47:25.160	00:47:27.840	puts it in a bind. They just, because the labor
724	00:47:27.850	00:47:30.660	agreement is only two years old, and this is only
725	00:47:30.670	00:47:33.300	the second year of testing, they're kind of locked into
726	00:47:33.310	00:47:37.520	the current program unless the union leadership changes its stance,
727	00:47:37.530	00:47:40.220	and I don't know if that's going to happen. The
728	00:47:40.230	00:47:43.650	players internally within the union, I think, the vast majority
729	00:47:43.660	00:47:48.940	of them want a more stronger testing program, but the
730	00:47:48.950	00:47:51.370	union leadership I don't think wants to give away this
731	00:47:51.380	00:47:54.800	issue when they're not in a situation where they're negotiating
732	00:47:54.810	00:47:57.380	a new contract with the owners. Well, break that down
733	00:47:57.390	00:48:00.780	for us. You say the players want it. But the
734	00:48:00.790	00:48:05.240	union is resisting it or treats it as a negotiating
735	00:48:05.250	00:48:10.730	bargaining chip. That seems almost contradictory. Well, a couple years
736	00:48:10.740	00:48:13.730	ago U.S.A. Today did a poll of players and they
737	00:48:13.740	00:48:18.010	polled about 550 of 750 players, and 79% of the
738	00:48:18.020	00:48:21.760	players in a private poll said that they preferred a
739	00:48:21.770	00:48:24.440	strong testing system. I think most of the players look
740	00:48:24.450	00:48:28.930	at steroid users as a threat to the others, competitively,
741	00:48:28.940	00:48:32.370	financially, because they're taking jobs away from players who are
742	00:48:32.380	00:48:35.380	not using it, and they don't know what the risks
743	00:48:35.390	00:48:38.880	are healthwise. And they're I think a little worried about
744	00:48:38.890	00:48:40.680	if I use this stuff what's going to happen to
745	00:48:40.690	00:48:44.010	me in ten years, as one player said to me
746	00:48:44.020	00:48:46.710	this spring, I have to wonder if I'm going to
747	00:48:46.720	00:48:49.770	be able to see my children go through their weddings.
748	00:48:49.780	00:48:51.860	That's a difficult situation for the players. On the other
749	00:48:51.870	00:48:55.910	hand, the union leadership has always taken the public stance
750	00:48:55.920	00:48:58.430	that this is a privacy issue for the players, they
751	00:48:58.440	00:49:01.200	don't want players to have to submit to random drug
752	00:49:01.210	00:49:04.900	tests, not only for steroids, but for other drugs. They
753	00:49:04.910	00:49:07.320	feel like that's an infringement upon the players. But I
754	00:49:07.330	00:49:11.390	also think that because they are not currently negotiating a
755	00:49:11.400	00:49:13.820	contract, this is an issue they don't want to give
756	00:49:13.830	00:49:18.140	away for free. You mentioned you were at spring training,
757	00:49:18.150	00:49:22.280	and I wonder what you heard there, whether players talked
758	00:49:22.290	00:49:26.130	about possibly using steroids and now getting off it? Did
759	00:49:26.140	00:49:29.410	you see any evidence of that? There is, there are
760	00:49:29.420	00:49:31.770	a lot of executive scouts you talk to and looking
761	00:49:31.780	00:49:34.660	at the players because this is the first year where
762	00:49:34.670	00:49:38.360	a player can be suspended for steroid use, the bodies
763	00:49:38.370	00:49:41.800	are definitely smaller, were definitely smaller around spring training, you
764	00:49:41.810	00:49:44.880	look around baseball, you can see the effect that the
765	00:49:44.890	00:49:47.480	testing is having on it. The question is whether or
766	00:49:47.490	00:49:51.440	not because they're not strong penalties, is this going to
767	00:49:51.450	00:49:54.360	be a lasting effect. Most of the players don't think
768	00:49:54.370	00:49:57.310	so. The players who want stronger testing think the current
769	00:49:57.320	00:50:01.420	system is a joke. You basically, since the beginning of
770	00:50:01.430	00:50:03.300	last year, you could have stood in the middle of
771	00:50:03.310	00:50:08.060	the clubhouse, taken steroids in front of every reporter, every
772	00:50:08.070	00:50:11.940	teammate four times and before you were actually subject to
773	00:50:11.950	00:50:17.630	suspension. Right, and it wasn't actually grounds for that sort
774	00:50:17.640	00:50:21.060	of action at that point. What about the owners? When
775	00:50:21.070	00:50:24.180	you talk to them, when you interview them, what level
776	00:50:24.190	00:50:29.840	of concern and if they reflect Commissioner Selig's opinion that
777	00:50:29.850	00:50:34.340	there ought to be widespread random testing and a real
778	00:50:34.350	00:50:38.930	program here, why does it happen? Well, one of the
779	00:50:38.940	00:50:41.160	owners said to me last year that baseball moves like
780	00:50:41.170	00:50:44.750	a dreadnought. It takes a very long time to change
781	00:50:44.760	00:50:48.060	direction. There are a lot of indications in the mid-nineties
782	00:50:48.070	00:50:51.240	when you looked at how bodies were changing that steroids
783	00:50:51.250	00:50:54.690	was becoming a growing problem in baseball, and yet it
784	00:50:54.700	00:50:57.550	really hasn't been until the last couple years in which
785	00:50:57.560	00:51:00.850	the owners stepped in to address the problem and not
786	00:51:00.860	00:51:04.380	until the last few weeks when the owners have been
787	00:51:04.390	00:51:08.220	particularly loud about addressing this issue. My own feeling is
788	00:51:08.230	00:51:11.120	that Commissioner Selig, he knows which way the wind is
789	00:51:11.130	00:51:14.960	blowing on this, and he knows essentially it's a situation
790	00:51:14.970	00:51:16.550	where the union is going to have to address this
791	00:51:16.560	00:51:20.460	before he can. Meanwhile of course we're getting records broken
792	00:51:20.470	00:51:26.840	year after year: Home run records, pitching is stronger and
793	00:51:26.850	00:51:30.750	more frequent. I wonder what you think of that as
794	00:51:30.760	00:51:34.240	a development and whether you attribute it to steroid use
795	00:51:34.250	00:51:39.310	on the first level, and secondly, if so, whether the
796	00:51:39.320	00:51:41.600	whole era, the steroid era if you want to call
797	00:51:41.610	00:51:46.430	it that, needs to have an asterisk attached to it.
798	00:51:46.440	00:51:48.670	Well, I don't think you can attach something like that
799	00:51:48.680	00:51:51.780	to the era simply because you can't prove whether or
800	00:51:51.790	00:51:54.140	not a player used it. I have no doubt that
801	00:51:54.150	00:51:56.740	steroids have had a huge impact, and not only on
802	00:51:56.750	00:51:59.800	the hitters. There's an assumption that because hitters can gain
803	00:51:59.810	00:52:03.910	a tangible result getting stronger that they are the ones
804	00:52:03.920	00:52:06.590	who use it. A lot of pitchers are using this
805	00:52:06.600	00:52:09.320	stuff. I presume by looking at the bodies and from
806	00:52:09.330	00:52:12.580	talking with the players. It's because they can in taking
807	00:52:12.590	00:52:15.550	steroids they can bounce back from pitching in a game
808	00:52:15.560	00:52:19.040	much more quickly if they use the steroids. And you
809	00:52:19.050	00:52:20.750	look around at some of the pitchers who have been
810	00:52:20.760	00:52:23.690	very successful in recent years, and there's a lot of
811	00:52:23.700	00:52:26.330	suspicion about whether or not they use steroids. It has
812	00:52:26.340	00:52:30.940	been a huge factor in baseball, again, since the mid-nineties.
813	00:52:30.950	00:52:33.620	And you as someone who watches baseball all the time
814	00:52:33.630	00:52:36.030	and is up close to the players, you can actually
815	00:52:36.040	00:52:39.450	physically see the difference, you can see that they're more
816	00:52:39.460	00:52:42.450	muscular, more built up, as a result of what you
817	00:52:42.460	00:52:47.830	assume is steroid use? No question. And suddenly the bodies
818	00:52:47.840	00:52:50.990	look like they have helium in them, the upper bodies,
819	00:52:51.000	00:52:54.410	the foreheads squared off, you hear stories about how players
820	00:52:54.420	00:52:58.500	capsizes are changing after they turn 30 years old. I
821	00:52:58.510	00:53:01.770	walked up to a player last spring, and I could
822	00:53:01.780	00:53:04.400	not believe the difference in him physically, and I thought
823	00:53:04.410	00:53:06.670	he was embarrassed. He would never acknowledge to me that
824	00:53:06.680	00:53:08.650	he used steroids, but you could see it in his
825	00:53:08.660	00:53:10.530	eye, he was in a position where he felt like
826	00:53:10.540	00:53:12.920	he needed to take this to keep up with other
827	00:53:12.930	00:53:16.350	players who were using and it was unbelievable to see
828	00:53:16.360	00:53:19.610	the difference in his arms, shoulders and in his forehead.
829	00:53:19.620	00:53:23.850	One of the older players who hold those records, the
830	00:53:23.860	00:53:27.010	Hall of Famers, when you talk to them, what do
831	00:53:27.020	00:53:31.940	they say about this? I think there's a quiet resentment,
832	00:53:31.950	00:53:35.610	and more players, more Hall of Fame players, more star
833	00:53:35.620	00:53:38.860	players are speaking out on this. Jim Palmer spoke out
834	00:53:38.870	00:53:41.040	on it, was the Hall of Fame pitcher for the
835	00:53:41.050	00:53:44.370	Baltimore Orioles, talked about it a couple weeks ago, just
836	00:53:44.380	00:53:48.920	yesterday Cecil Fielder, who became the first player in about
837	00:53:48.930	00:53:52.570	50 years to hit 50 home runs, he basically suggested,
838	00:53:52.580	00:53:55.160	he mentioned by name players who he thought were taking
839	00:53:55.170	00:53:59.160	steroids. They feel like that their records, their accomplishments have
840	00:53:59.170	00:54:02.370	lost the context that they should have because the numbers
841	00:54:02.380	00:54:06.010	are being put up by suspected steroid users. Clearly a
842	00:54:06.020	00:54:08.550	lot of people think it needs more looking into. Buster
843	00:54:08.560	00:54:20.390	Olney, thank you very much. Thank you. Again, the major
844	00:54:20.400	00:54:23.840	developments of the day. U.S.-led forces struck back against the
845	00:54:23.850	00:54:28.060	armed resistance by Shiite militias in Iraq. And President Bush
846	00:54:28.070	00:54:30.800	said the June 30 transfer of power in Iraq would
847	00:54:30.810	00:54:42.420	stick, despite the violence. And again, to our honor roll
848	00:54:42.430	00:54:45.730	of American service personnel killed in Iraq. We add them
849	00:54:45.740	00:54:49.990	as their deaths are made official and photographs become available.
850	00:54:50.000	00:56:01.870	Here, in silence, are 11 more. We'll see you online,
851	00:56:01.880	00:56:04.700	and again here tomorrow evening. I'm Jim Lehrer. Thank you
852	00:56:04.710	01:03:56.788	and good night.
