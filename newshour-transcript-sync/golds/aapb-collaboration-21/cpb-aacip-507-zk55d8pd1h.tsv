1	00:02:26.520	00:02:30.250	Good evening. Leading the news this Wednesday, Nicaragua's Sandinista government
2	00:02:30.260	00:02:34.180	declared a unilateral cease-fire in the war against the contras.
3	00:02:34.190	00:02:38.280	The Supreme Court issued two rulings expanding police search powers,
4	00:02:38.290	00:02:41.330	and the space shuttle Atlantis was successfully launched after five
5	00:02:41.340	00:02:44.130	attempts. We'll have details in our News Summary in a
6	00:02:44.140	00:02:48.320	moment. Jim. After the News Summary, Kwame Holman interviews the
7	00:02:48.330	00:02:52.400	defeated President of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega. We have a debate
8	00:02:52.410	00:02:56.630	over using criminal charges against corporations such as Exxon. The
9	00:02:56.640	00:03:00.210	debaters are lawyers Robert Adler and Richard Samp. And then
10	00:03:00.220	00:03:03.470	two views of a new report on medical malpractice. They
11	00:03:03.480	00:03:06.820	are those of New York State Health Commissioner David Axelrod
12	00:03:06.830	00:03:50.850	and Lawyer Dr. Harvey Wachsman. Nicaragua's Sandinista government today declared
13	00:03:50.860	00:03:55.150	a unilateral cease-fire in the war against the U.S.-backed contras.
14	00:03:55.160	00:03:58.220	President Daniel Ortega said the decision was made to achieve
15	00:03:58.230	00:04:02.350	the immediate de-mobilization of the contras. In an exclusive interview
16	00:04:02.360	00:04:05.790	with the Newshour, Mr. Ortega was asked by Correspondent Kwame
17	00:04:05.800	00:04:08.850	Holman what would be the consequences if the contras did
18	00:04:08.860	00:04:18.570	not disband. That's extremely serious because that threatens all of
19	00:04:18.580	00:04:27.480	the security of the entire country. Well, as long as
20	00:04:27.490	00:04:30.350	I'm President, I'm going to take whatever measures are necessary
21	00:04:30.360	00:04:35.400	in order to ensure the defense of our country and
22	00:04:35.410	00:04:41.280	the security of each and every citizen, because the alternative
23	00:04:41.290	00:04:44.630	would be a civil war. We will have the full
24	00:04:44.640	00:04:47.330	interview with Mr. Ortega after the News Summary. At a
25	00:04:47.340	00:04:51.820	news conference President-elect Violeta Chamorro joined Ortega in calling for
26	00:04:51.830	00:04:54.800	an end to hostilities. She said the causes that started
27	00:04:54.810	00:04:57.660	the civil war have now disappeared and appealed to the
28	00:04:57.670	00:05:01.860	contras to return home peacefully. A contra spokesman in Honduras
29	00:05:01.870	00:05:04.400	said his fighters are ready to discuss this with Mrs.
30	00:05:04.410	00:05:09.810	Chamorro. The spokesman, Alejandro Elsavedo cautioned "Without us here, there
31	00:05:09.820	00:05:12.790	is no one to insist that Ortega step down. But
32	00:05:12.800	00:05:16.250	under the right conditions, we would demobilize sooner." There are
33	00:05:16.260	00:05:20.460	believed to be 10,000 U.S.-backed rebels based in Honduras. In
34	00:05:20.470	00:05:23.680	Washington, Secretary of State Baker said today that the United
35	00:05:23.690	00:05:26.940	States agrees the contras should be disbanded. He made his
36	00:05:26.950	00:05:46.790	comments before a Senate committee. -- We think that with good
37	00:05:46.800	00:05:50.070	will and the support of the international community, the U.N.,
38	00:05:50.080	00:05:53.280	the OAS, and others that this issue can be resolved
39	00:05:53.290	00:05:56.480	and we think it will be resolved. The war is
40	00:05:56.490	00:06:00.910	over, Mr. Chairman, in Nicaragua. Pres. Bush called Soviet Pres.
41	00:06:00.920	00:06:04.300	Gorbachev this morning to discuss the Nicaragua situation and other
42	00:06:04.310	00:06:08.120	matters. Mr. Bush said the conversation lasted about 40 minutes.
43	00:06:08.130	00:06:11.140	He described to reporters aboard Air Force 1 on his
44	00:06:11.150	00:06:14.950	way to a political appearance in New York. This morning
45	00:06:14.960	00:06:23.900	I had a very good talk with Pres. Gorbachev. We
46	00:06:23.910	00:06:28.620	touched on matters relating to Nicaragua and Central America, and
47	00:06:28.630	00:06:33.370	also matters relating to the changes in Europe. It was
48	00:06:33.380	00:06:35.260	a very -- I'm not going to say any more of
49	00:06:35.270	00:06:38.270	the details of the talk, but the, it was a
50	00:06:38.280	00:06:43.920	very constructive conversation. Why did you want to call -- Discussing
51	00:06:43.930	00:06:48.080	these two areas -- and I'm not going to go into
52	00:06:48.090	00:06:50.300	the details of the talk, but I think it's important
53	00:06:50.310	00:06:54.400	that there be some confidentiality if we're going to be
54	00:06:54.410	00:06:58.070	able to speak as frankly as we did today. The
55	00:06:58.080	00:07:00.900	President said he and Gorbachev plan to continue such one
56	00:07:00.910	00:07:05.230	on one consultations. Jim. The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled
57	00:07:05.240	00:07:08.630	on two right to search cases. The court approved the
58	00:07:08.640	00:07:12.540	search of an armed robbery suspect's Maryland home. They said
59	00:07:12.550	00:07:15.380	no search warrant was needed because there was a reasonable
60	00:07:15.390	00:07:19.130	belief a dangerous person was hiding inside. In the other
61	00:07:19.140	00:07:23.020	case, federal agents, also without a warrant, searched a suspected
62	00:07:23.030	00:07:27.190	Mexican drug dealer's home in Mexico. The Justices again said
63	00:07:27.200	00:07:31.610	none was needed because the U.S. Constitution's ban against unreasonable
64	00:07:31.620	00:07:36.660	searches does not apply to non-Americans outside U.S. borders. Also
65	00:07:36.670	00:07:40.910	in Washington today, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry pleaded innocent to
66	00:07:40.920	00:07:44.990	eight counts of cocaine possession and lying to a grand
67	00:07:45.000	00:07:48.190	jury. A U.S. District Court judge set a June 4th
68	00:07:48.200	00:07:53.070	trial date. The Northrop Corporation has pleaded guilty to falsifying
69	00:07:53.080	00:07:56.180	test data on two weapons systems sold to the U.S.
70	00:07:56.190	00:08:00.650	military. The defense contractor admitted giving the government false information
71	00:08:00.660	00:08:04.470	about defective parts for the Cruise Missile and Harrier Jet.
72	00:08:04.480	00:08:08.150	Northrop agreed to pay a $17 million fine. The company
73	00:08:08.160	00:08:11.520	is also under investigation for fraud in its Stealth Bomber
74	00:08:11.530	00:08:16.350	program. The space shuttle Atlantis began a secret military mission
75	00:08:16.360	00:08:20.150	today. It blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, just before
76	00:08:20.160	00:08:23.600	3 AM Eastern Time. Its flight path took it up
77	00:08:23.610	00:08:26.620	the East Coast. It was reportedly seen as far North
78	00:08:26.630	00:08:30.770	as Washington, D.C. Five previous attempts to launch the shuttle
79	00:08:30.780	00:08:34.590	were scrubbed due to poor weather, computer problems and Mission
80	00:08:34.600	00:08:38.410	Commander John Creyton's cold. The crew is expected to remain
81	00:08:38.420	00:08:41.650	in space until Sunday. The primary mission is believed to
82	00:08:41.660	00:08:46.100	be the deployment of a spy satellite. The U.S. government
83	00:08:46.110	00:08:49.590	today revised its latest figure on economic growth for the
84	00:08:49.600	00:08:52.580	better. The Commerce Department said the gross national product for
85	00:08:52.590	00:08:57.020	the last quarter of 1989 grew by .9 percent instead
86	00:08:57.030	00:09:00.480	of the initial estimate of .5 percent. It's still the
87	00:09:00.490	00:09:03.920	slowest growth rate in three years. It brings the GNP
88	00:09:03.930	00:09:07.620	increase for all of 1989 to 3 percent compared to
89	00:09:07.630	00:09:12.230	4.4 percent the previous year. The Soviet parliament today approved
90	00:09:12.240	00:09:16.460	a new law allowing individuals to lease farm land. Farmers
91	00:09:16.470	00:09:18.980	will also be able to pass on the leases to
92	00:09:18.990	00:09:22.380	their children. The law is part of Pres. Gorbachev's plan
93	00:09:22.390	00:09:26.980	to restructure the nation's economy. It overturns the longstanding socialist
94	00:09:26.990	00:09:30.890	policy against private land use. But the sale or outright
95	00:09:30.900	00:09:33.770	ownership of land will still be barred under the new
96	00:09:33.780	00:09:36.810	law. And that's it for the News Summary tonight. Now
97	00:09:36.820	00:09:41.040	it's on to Pres. Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, criminal charges
98	00:09:41.050	00:09:55.890	against Exxon, and a new medical malpractice report. We begin
99	00:09:55.900	00:09:59.650	tonight with a News Maker interview with Nicaragua's outgoing President
100	00:09:59.660	00:10:03.200	Daniel Ortega. Mr. Ortega and the woman who defeated him
101	00:10:03.210	00:10:07.030	on Sunday Violeta Chamorro have began negotiations on a peaceful
102	00:10:07.040	00:10:10.300	democratic changeover of power which would be the first in
103	00:10:10.310	00:10:13.750	Nicaragua's history. A major stumbling block is the fate of
104	00:10:13.760	00:10:17.610	the Anti-Sandanista Contras, the rebel group financed by the United
105	00:10:17.620	00:10:22.090	States. Earlier today Correspondent Kwame Holman talked to President Ortega
106	00:10:22.100	00:10:26.670	in Managua. The interpreter was Alejandro Bendana, the Secretary General
107	00:10:26.680	00:10:30.210	of the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry. Thank you for being here
108	00:10:30.220	00:10:37.340	Mr. President. Were you surprised by the election results. Did
109	00:10:37.350	00:10:40.650	you know at any time before hand that the outcome
110	00:10:40.660	00:10:53.710	would go against you? Frankly it is in the nature
111	00:10:53.720	00:11:01.460	of any election to consider the possibility of losing. But
112	00:11:01.470	00:11:05.150	I thought that we could reach a majority. The UNO
113	00:11:05.160	00:11:11.030	had been depicted by many as disorganized and unable to
114	00:11:11.040	00:11:17.470	win. Why do you think your party was rejected by
115	00:11:17.480	00:11:24.650	the people? Well the people had two options before them,
116	00:11:24.660	00:11:30.670	at least perceived that. The Perenta which was saying that
117	00:11:30.680	00:11:36.260	everything was going to get better and the UNO basically
118	00:11:36.270	00:11:45.820	having the same message. And the people, of course, had
119	00:11:45.830	00:11:53.600	been strongly pressured because of American policy particularly in their
120	00:11:53.610	00:12:00.350	economic terms and social terms. So that many people that
121	00:12:00.360	00:12:04.520	did give their vote to UNO will have their heart
122	00:12:04.530	00:12:11.930	with Perenta. But what they said was that may be
123	00:12:11.940	00:12:15.120	with UNO the problems that Perenta was not able to
124	00:12:15.130	00:12:19.850	solve can be solved and that would explain why the
125	00:12:19.860	00:12:24.280	vote went the way that it did. At the rally
126	00:12:24.290	00:12:33.940	yesterday were those positions demands of the incoming government and
127	00:12:33.950	00:12:45.160	which would you consider the most important? These are now
128	00:12:45.170	00:12:48.030	the demands of the Opposition of the Sandinista Front, of
129	00:12:48.040	00:12:56.970	the biggest political party in Nicaragua and these demands have
130	00:12:56.980	00:13:09.660	to do with the basis of the revolutionary process. And
131	00:13:09.670	00:13:12.270	I feel that there has to be a consensus that
132	00:13:12.280	00:13:15.810	the fundamental basis of the revolution should not be altered
133	00:13:15.820	00:13:20.590	because that would be altering democracy. Democracy should be strengthened.
134	00:13:20.600	00:13:23.770	And which are the primary or the most important aspects
135	00:13:23.780	00:13:38.420	of that? The agrarian reform for example, having the bank
136	00:13:38.430	00:13:51.420	and natural resources in State hands, to respect the professional
137	00:13:51.430	00:13:55.650	character and the institutionality of the Army and the Ministry
138	00:13:55.660	00:14:03.170	of the Interior. That State employees should not get fired
139	00:14:03.180	00:14:10.740	wholesale. These were indeed parts of their platform. Indeed they
140	00:14:10.750	00:14:16.110	were. Is it reasonable for Mrs. Chamorro to call for
141	00:14:16.120	00:14:26.980	the ouster of your brother as head of the Army?
142	00:14:26.990	00:14:30.300	Well she has the right to speak out and to
143	00:14:30.310	00:14:37.800	take a position but she must also take in to
144	00:14:37.810	00:14:41.310	account the realities that have come about over the last
145	00:14:41.320	00:14:53.150	few years and the changes that have taken place. Indeed
146	00:14:53.160	00:14:55.990	she should be thankful to the revolution for having been
147	00:14:56.000	00:15:09.720	able to achieve the Presidency. So she should take into
148	00:15:09.730	00:15:15.490	account those elements of the revolution which different sectors consider
149	00:15:15.500	00:15:20.200	vital to feeling secure. So in essence you would accept
150	00:15:20.210	00:15:24.410	the ouster of top military and political people but not
151	00:15:24.420	00:15:34.800	much further down into the army, into the bureaucracy? These
152	00:15:34.810	00:15:45.160	are points that are still being dealt with. The negotiations
153	00:15:45.170	00:15:50.880	for the transition are taking place and this is some
154	00:15:50.890	00:15:57.520	of the subject matters that have to be covered. President
155	00:15:57.530	00:16:01.920	Gorbachev and President Bush have both accepted the results of
156	00:16:01.930	00:16:08.750	the election. Have you spoken to Mr. Gorbachev? No I
157	00:16:08.760	00:16:12.960	haven't. Do you feel that there was any role that
158	00:16:12.970	00:16:16.350	Mr. Gorbachev and the Soviet Union could have played prior
159	00:16:16.360	00:16:19.930	to the election that would have helped you in the
160	00:16:19.940	00:16:27.970	election as the United States provided funds for the opposition
161	00:16:27.980	00:16:41.840	party? Well this was an election among Nicaraguans but there
162	00:16:41.850	00:16:48.520	is no denying of reality that the whole of Nicaragua
163	00:16:48.530	00:16:57.690	was under siege by U.S. pressures, U.S. sanctions, U.S. policy.
164	00:16:57.700	00:17:01.950	So our elections did take place but in very special
165	00:17:01.960	00:17:10.910	conditions. Like people with a gun to the head of
166	00:17:10.920	00:17:16.980	our people. It was a gun that took the form
167	00:17:16.990	00:17:25.190	of economic embargo as a result of U.S. policy. Elections
168	00:17:25.200	00:17:35.120	that took place under U.S. threat and what the U.S.
169	00:17:35.130	00:17:37.110	was virtually saying to the Nicaraguan people is that if
170	00:17:37.120	00:17:39.800	you don't vote for UNO then the War and the
171	00:17:39.810	00:17:46.530	economic sanctions are going to continue. And what the Soviet
172	00:17:46.540	00:17:48.600	Union has done on the other hand to be respectful
173	00:17:48.610	00:17:55.430	of the sovereign decision of the Nicaraguan people. And they
174	00:17:55.440	00:17:59.610	were respectful of our taking up the challenge of realizing
175	00:17:59.620	00:18:06.720	undergoing elections under conditions that were extraordinary. So these were
176	00:18:06.730	00:18:13.150	neither fair nor just conditions for the Sandinista Front. And
177	00:18:13.160	00:18:16.190	then in that sense the people did not have much
178	00:18:16.200	00:18:20.170	of a range in which to choose. Yet you believe
179	00:18:20.180	00:18:22.150	that the elections were free and fair and that the
180	00:18:22.160	00:18:33.980	people expressed their true will? Yes, the people did have
181	00:18:33.990	00:18:41.660	the right to put forth their choice, but the fact
182	00:18:41.670	00:18:44.480	is the context in which these elections took place was
183	00:18:44.490	00:18:48.300	one of having a gun to the head of every
184	00:18:48.310	00:18:58.160	Nicaraguan. Secretary Baker said the Contras should disband, Mrs. Chamorro
185	00:18:58.170	00:19:03.580	said so, you said that should happen prior to April
186	00:19:03.590	00:19:09.090	25th. The Contras have responded that they will not disband
187	00:19:09.100	00:19:13.270	before the inauguration of the new Government. What do you
188	00:19:13.280	00:19:22.380	think of that position? That is extremely serious because that
189	00:19:22.390	00:19:39.570	threatens all of the security of the entire country. And
190	00:19:39.580	00:19:43.000	indeed it is contrary to the decision I have just
191	00:19:43.010	00:19:47.330	taken to order a cease-fire in order to facilitate the
192	00:19:47.340	00:19:50.400	disbandment of this mobilization of the Contras so that they
193	00:19:50.410	00:19:53.150	can come home and that indeed we could have peace
194	00:19:53.160	00:19:56.870	and tranquility by April 25th on which the transition date
195	00:19:56.880	00:19:59.880	will take place. What great difference would it make if
196	00:19:59.890	00:20:17.860	the Contras disbanded now versus waited until April 25th? First
197	00:20:17.870	00:20:22.400	of all, there is an agreement among the Central American
198	00:20:22.410	00:20:27.060	Presidents that has been abided by Nicaragua, but that has
199	00:20:27.070	00:20:36.120	not been respected by the Contras. And then there is
200	00:20:36.130	00:20:39.190	the security which we must insure of all those people
201	00:20:39.200	00:20:44.670	who voted for us and that indeed amounts to over
202	00:20:44.680	00:20:50.640	40 percent of the electorate and they feel threatened by
203	00:20:50.650	00:21:00.450	the Contras especially now that the opposition has been victorious.
204	00:21:00.460	00:21:05.420	So we have to insure the security for these people.
205	00:21:05.430	00:21:08.070	That is a very important issue, I think that you
206	00:21:08.080	00:21:13.340	say that it is the critical issue. Can that be
207	00:21:13.350	00:21:20.340	negotiated and if it is not negotiated to your satisfaction
208	00:21:20.350	00:21:24.330	will you take the kinds of actions some describe such
209	00:21:24.340	00:21:38.280	as strikes making the country ungovernable? Well, as long as
210	00:21:38.290	00:21:40.230	I am President, I am going to take whatever measures
211	00:21:40.240	00:21:46.250	are necessary to insure the defense of our country and
212	00:21:46.260	00:21:52.120	the security of each and every citizen because the alternative
213	00:21:52.130	00:21:59.870	would be a civil war. And indeed it would be
214	00:21:59.880	00:22:05.290	terrible when we have made so much progress that we
215	00:22:05.300	00:22:15.680	should be confronted with that. So all Nicaraguans have to
216	00:22:15.690	00:22:22.310	join hands along with the United States in order to
217	00:22:22.320	00:22:26.730	clear up this Contra matter once and for all. You
218	00:22:26.740	00:22:33.570	have asked for no further offenses against the Contras. If
219	00:22:33.580	00:22:38.850	the Contras should be involved in some offensive of some
220	00:22:38.860	00:22:43.510	kind are you saying that you would take action against
221	00:22:43.520	00:22:56.640	them? This morning what we have done is ordered our
222	00:22:56.650	00:23:00.760	troops to halt any offensive operations in order to allow
223	00:23:00.770	00:23:10.180	the Contras to demobilize peacefully but if they choose not
224	00:23:10.190	00:23:15.560	to demobilize then I will have to take other steps
225	00:23:15.570	00:23:19.130	because my obligation is to insure the safety and security
226	00:23:19.140	00:23:23.220	of every Nicaraguan. Can that issue of demobilization and when
227	00:23:23.230	00:23:31.580	be negotiated successfully? Well, we feel that it has to
228	00:23:31.590	00:23:43.520	take place before April 25th. If there is not war
229	00:23:43.530	00:23:49.960	between armies, the Contras and the Government Army, some fear
230	00:23:49.970	00:23:56.060	war in the streets among party members from both sides
231	00:23:56.070	00:24:02.800	that could perhaps escalate in to something more serious. Do
232	00:24:02.810	00:24:17.520	you fear that? Here in lies the importance indeed of
233	00:24:17.530	00:24:21.010	the talks that are going on between the respective transition
234	00:24:21.020	00:24:26.190	teams. On our part General Ortega and on the other
235	00:24:26.200	00:24:42.010	part UNO Mr. Antonio Lacaia. So when there the items
236	00:24:42.020	00:24:44.730	in relation to the future of the Interior Ministry and
237	00:24:44.740	00:24:48.170	the army are being dealt with because this is something
238	00:24:48.180	00:24:52.110	all Nicaraguan have a stake in because these institutions are
239	00:24:52.120	00:24:57.190	for the security of every one. When will the negotiations
240	00:24:57.200	00:25:01.630	begin in earnest and are you happy so far with
241	00:25:01.640	00:25:15.660	the talks? Well the talks began yesterday and indeed we
242	00:25:15.670	00:25:19.550	published a statement that they had began and the respective
243	00:25:19.560	00:25:26.740	transition teams have been named and they are going to
244	00:25:26.750	00:25:37.620	continue meeting regularly. They used to ask us to act
245	00:25:37.630	00:25:40.600	with flexibility, with realism, and with maturity. Now we are
246	00:25:40.610	00:25:47.900	asking them to act with realism, flexibility, and maturity. When
247	00:25:47.910	00:25:52.520	some look at the events in Eastern Europe and the
248	00:25:52.530	00:25:59.230	events here it has been said that there is an
249	00:25:59.240	00:26:10.150	anti-Marxist tide in the World. Your response. There is no
250	00:26:10.160	00:26:21.370	anti-Marxist tide here. It is rather that you have enormous
251	00:26:21.380	00:26:25.090	reaction here to the War to the crisis which has
252	00:26:25.100	00:26:32.850	been posed by the United States on the Nicaraguan people.
253	00:26:32.860	00:26:34.320	Because you have to take in to account that the
254	00:26:34.330	00:26:38.780	Sandinistas continue to be the strongest and largest single political
255	00:26:38.790	00:26:45.480	party in Nicaragua which is a far different situation which
256	00:26:45.490	00:26:50.580	you have in Eastern Europe. Does the election have significance
257	00:26:50.590	00:27:06.930	will it effect things in Mr. Castro's Cuba? We in
258	00:27:06.940	00:27:11.910	our relations with Cuba we have Party to Party relations
259	00:27:11.920	00:27:16.490	as we do with a number of Parties as we
260	00:27:16.500	00:27:25.510	do have with members of the Socialists International. I can't
261	00:27:25.520	00:27:29.590	speak of the attitude that the Cuban Government is going
262	00:27:29.600	00:27:36.020	to assume with respect to the new Government. Were you
263	00:27:36.030	00:27:45.760	personally saddened by the results for your own relations with
264	00:27:45.770	00:28:03.160	the voting public? Yes it was a difficult situation but
265	00:28:03.170	00:28:05.560	I had always been convinced that there was a real
266	00:28:05.570	00:28:11.960	risk of losing the election. And what is really important
267	00:28:11.970	00:28:16.860	here is not who won the Sandinistas or UNO. The
268	00:28:16.870	00:28:21.410	important thing was that the elections did take place and
269	00:28:21.420	00:28:25.330	that those elections should be free fair and clean and
270	00:28:25.340	00:28:30.260	we Sandinistas managed to accomplish that objective. What is the
271	00:28:30.270	00:28:39.010	political future of Daniel Ortega? I continue to be with
272	00:28:39.020	00:28:43.610	the people with the Sandinista but I am now going
273	00:28:43.620	00:28:48.190	to be working on a different basis and we are
274	00:28:48.200	00:28:53.130	going to govern from the law sort of speak to
275	00:28:53.140	00:29:00.430	defend what we have won the revolutionary conquests to demand
276	00:29:00.440	00:29:03.090	that UNO comply with all those programs that it said
277	00:29:03.100	00:29:09.270	it was going to do in behalf of the people.
278	00:29:09.280	00:29:14.000	We will support everything in the UNO Government that appears
279	00:29:14.010	00:29:19.670	toward the national interest, toward the people's interest. You said
280	00:29:19.680	00:29:40.420	we leave the scene victorious. What do you mean? Because
281	00:29:40.430	00:29:45.940	the Sandinistas never sought out to create a one party
282	00:29:45.950	00:29:57.190	state and there were elections here in 1984 but these
283	00:29:57.200	00:30:10.250	in 1990 were even more important. If indeed we were
284	00:30:10.260	00:30:14.120	put to the acid test our commitment to democracy and
285	00:30:14.130	00:30:24.860	the best proof that we met this test was the
286	00:30:24.870	00:30:47.140	election and the results. You see if we had won
287	00:30:47.150	00:30:48.840	the elections there would have been those that would have
288	00:30:48.850	00:30:51.610	called fraud, there had been intimidation, that it had not
289	00:30:51.620	00:30:57.700	been fair but now as a result of these election
290	00:30:57.710	00:31:03.900	results what you have indeed is the consolidation of democracy.
291	00:31:03.910	00:31:07.700	Thank you very much for joining us Mr. President. Still
292	00:31:07.710	00:31:23.370	ahead on the Newshour indicting Exxon and Medical malpractice. Now
293	00:31:23.380	00:31:26.830	the criminal case against the Exxon Corporation. It was brought
294	00:31:26.840	00:31:31.140	yesterday in Anchorage, Alaska, in a five count indictment growing
295	00:31:31.150	00:31:35.200	out of last year's Alaska oil spill. It charges Exxon
296	00:31:35.210	00:31:41.000	with willfully and knowingly allowing unlicensed employees and others known
297	00:31:41.010	00:31:44.870	to be physically or mentally incapable to operate the tanker
298	00:31:44.880	00:31:48.480	Exxon Valdez. The company said yesterday it will fight the
299	00:31:48.490	00:31:51.430	charges in court. If convicted, it could be fined more
300	00:31:51.440	00:31:55.400	than $1 billion. Exxon also faces more than 100 civil
301	00:31:55.410	00:31:59.990	suits. Neither Exxon nor the Justice Department accepted our invitation
302	00:32:00.000	00:32:02.920	to debate the case tonight. In their stead are two
303	00:32:02.930	00:32:06.410	lawyers who disagree about the wisdom of filing criminal cases
304	00:32:06.420	00:32:09.730	in such matters. Robert Adler is a senior attorney with
305	00:32:09.740	00:32:14.140	the National Resources Defense Council. The NRDC filed court papers
306	00:32:14.150	00:32:17.790	to oppose any plea bargain for Exxon. Richard Samp is
307	00:32:17.800	00:32:21.900	chief counsel for the Washington Legal Foundation. Mr. Adler, does
308	00:32:21.910	00:32:24.300	Exxon deserve to be treated as a criminal in this
309	00:32:24.310	00:32:28.250	matter? Absolutely. Our Congress has seen fit to provide in
310	00:32:28.260	00:32:32.900	our laws that corporations can be held criminally accountable for
311	00:32:32.910	00:32:37.180	environmental pollution. This was one of the major, most damaging
312	00:32:37.190	00:32:40.540	pollution incidents in U.S. history and they ought to be
313	00:32:40.550	00:32:46.510	held accountable. Normally, a criminal case is based on malicious
314	00:32:46.520	00:32:49.000	intent or whatever. Do you believe that that is the
315	00:32:49.010	00:32:53.380	case in the Exxon case? Well, I don't think that
316	00:32:53.390	00:32:58.330	Exxon deliberately intended to spill 11 million gallons of oil
317	00:32:58.340	00:33:02.540	into Alaskan waters, but it was clearly a highly negligent
318	00:33:02.550	00:33:05.430	operation that allowed this to happen and that allowed it
319	00:33:05.440	00:33:09.420	to be cleaned up almost not at all. If you
320	00:33:09.430	00:33:13.430	drive a car negligently and kill someone in the process,
321	00:33:13.440	00:33:16.990	you are held accountable, and the corporation should be held
322	00:33:17.000	00:33:20.450	as accountable as you or I. Mr. Samp, is Exxon
323	00:33:20.460	00:33:24.410	a criminal? They certainly are not. We would certainly with
324	00:33:24.420	00:33:27.750	Mr. Adler that it's important that Exxon be held accountable
325	00:33:27.760	00:33:30.160	if, in fact, it's been negligent in this case. But
326	00:33:30.170	00:33:32.910	the proper way to hold them accountable is to bring
327	00:33:32.920	00:33:36.810	civil actions against them where in the context normally used
328	00:33:36.820	00:33:41.720	in matters of negligence, their conduct can be judge. Criminal
329	00:33:41.730	00:33:46.320	liability is wholly inappropriate in cases where simply negligence is
330	00:33:46.330	00:33:50.140	charged. Why is that? Well, first of all, because we
331	00:33:50.150	00:33:53.650	have an understanding in our society that when someone is
332	00:33:53.660	00:33:57.250	branded a criminal that they are being branded as somebody
333	00:33:57.260	00:34:01.250	who has done something extremely wrong that they need to
334	00:34:01.260	00:34:06.430	be marked as someone who's highly culpable, and I don't
335	00:34:06.440	00:34:10.570	think that's true in this particular case. Secondly, the implications
336	00:34:10.580	00:34:14.720	to any corporation or any corporate official who is convicted
337	00:34:14.730	00:34:19.630	of a criminal charge are very huge in terms of
338	00:34:19.640	00:34:22.150	the ability of a corporation to survive after that point,
339	00:34:22.160	00:34:25.120	and we think that the punishment doesn't fit the crime.
340	00:34:25.130	00:34:28.520	Mr. Adler, what about this criminal intent business? Nobody when
341	00:34:28.530	00:34:31.760	somebody is accused of murder or burglary, it is usually
342	00:34:31.770	00:34:35.210	on the grounds that they intended to commit the murder
343	00:34:35.220	00:34:38.190	and they intended to burglarize. And even you concede in
344	00:34:38.200	00:34:41.840	this case that Exxon did not intend to spill the
345	00:34:41.850	00:34:45.320	oil. What's the difference here? Well, there are many analogies
346	00:34:45.330	00:34:49.410	in criminal law where we punish people under criminal statutes
347	00:34:49.420	00:34:53.410	for conduct which is not malicious and not deliberate. If
348	00:34:53.420	00:34:57.130	you negligently run a red light and you kill a
349	00:34:57.140	00:35:00.630	pedestrian in the process, then you can be prosecuted for
350	00:35:00.640	00:35:04.900	involuntary manslaughter under the criminal law. Even if there is
351	00:35:04.910	00:35:06.920	no intent obviously to run over the person at the
352	00:35:06.930	00:35:09.030	red light. That's right. And the point is that we
353	00:35:09.040	00:35:13.650	are punishing irresponsible conduct and we are deterring that person
354	00:35:13.660	00:35:17.370	and anyone else in society from engaging in such conduct.
355	00:35:17.380	00:35:22.720	Now Exxon was recklessly operating a tanker holding 50 million
356	00:35:22.730	00:35:26.360	gallons of oil in dangerous waters. They should be held
357	00:35:26.370	00:35:30.000	accountable just as you or I would for such conduct
358	00:35:30.010	00:35:32.860	driving an automobile. Mr. Samp, is that not a good
359	00:35:32.870	00:35:36.250	analogy between careless and reckless driving of a car versus
360	00:35:36.260	00:35:38.910	careless and reckless driving of a tanker? I don't think
361	00:35:38.920	00:35:41.180	so at all because first of all, we're talking about
362	00:35:41.190	00:35:44.650	criminal charges against a corporation and in the case of
363	00:35:44.660	00:35:47.520	a corporation, you're not going to send the corporation to
364	00:35:47.530	00:35:49.740	jail. It's just a matter of how heavily you're going
365	00:35:49.750	00:35:53.440	to be fining them, and in this particular case, Exxon
366	00:35:53.450	00:35:56.860	is certainly going to be deterred from any negligent conduct
367	00:35:56.870	00:35:59.420	in the future. They've already spent more than $2 billion
368	00:35:59.430	00:36:02.620	in the cleanup effort. They have paid compensation of close
369	00:36:02.630	00:36:07.420	to $200 million to residents of Alaska, including the fishermen
370	00:36:07.430	00:36:10.630	there. They are the subject of hundreds of civil suits
371	00:36:10.640	00:36:12.730	that have been filed against them, so I think it's
372	00:36:12.740	00:36:15.390	a little bit naive to suggest that there is no
373	00:36:15.400	00:36:18.000	deterrence in this case. Are there precedents for this kind
374	00:36:18.010	00:36:23.250	of action, Mr. Adler, an environmental disruption of this kind
375	00:36:23.260	00:36:26.520	that resulted in criminal charges, where there was not the
376	00:36:26.530	00:36:30.190	criminal intent to begin with? Certainly there are. When the
377	00:36:30.200	00:36:34.980	Ashland Oil Company spilled oil into the Ohio River two
378	00:36:34.990	00:36:39.380	years ago, the federal government brought criminal charges and successfully
379	00:36:39.390	00:36:43.810	settled that case. Let's talk about the notion of bringing
380	00:36:43.820	00:36:48.590	criminal charges against a corporation. Corporations in this country argue
381	00:36:48.600	00:36:51.430	all the time that they should have the same rights
382	00:36:51.440	00:36:55.350	as individuals, property rights, due process of law. If they
383	00:36:55.360	00:36:58.440	have the same rights, they have the same responsibilities as
384	00:36:58.450	00:37:02.580	well and they cannot be held above the law any
385	00:37:02.590	00:37:05.830	more than an individual. And yet in this case no
386	00:37:05.840	00:37:10.570	individuals, no individual executives or employees of Exxon were indicted,
387	00:37:10.580	00:37:13.640	just the corporation, so there is a difference. Up until
388	00:37:13.650	00:37:17.510	now, no individuals have been indicted. We think as a
389	00:37:17.520	00:37:20.640	matter of fact that the investigation ought to proceed and
390	00:37:20.650	00:37:25.240	if any individual corporate executives are found to be individually
391	00:37:25.250	00:37:28.500	responsible, then indictments ought to be brought against them as
392	00:37:28.510	00:37:31.450	well. How do you feel about that, Mr. Samp? Well,
393	00:37:31.460	00:37:34.210	obviously, the corporation can only act through individuals, so for
394	00:37:34.220	00:37:36.560	the government to prove its case, it's going to have
395	00:37:36.570	00:37:42.110	to prove that certain individuals at Exxon were negligent and
396	00:37:42.120	00:37:46.320	criminally so, so that obviously the government by bringing an
397	00:37:46.330	00:37:48.840	indictment against Exxon believes that there are people who are
398	00:37:48.850	00:37:52.240	criminally negligent out there. I think that if the government
399	00:37:52.250	00:37:56.070	realizes that it would be bad public relations to indict
400	00:37:56.080	00:38:00.990	the lower echelon employees who would be probably the ones
401	00:38:01.000	00:38:04.560	who would have known something about the Exxon Valdez, and
402	00:38:04.570	00:38:07.640	since this case is probably all a political show to
403	00:38:07.650	00:38:09.600	begin with, they realize that it was better just to
404	00:38:09.610	00:38:11.920	leave it at the corporation. A political show to begin
405	00:38:11.930	00:38:13.780	with, what do you mean? Well, it seems to me
406	00:38:13.790	00:38:16.580	that this administration has made it clear that it wants
407	00:38:16.590	00:38:20.210	to be tough and perceived to be tough on environmental
408	00:38:20.220	00:38:24.530	polluters and they have been pressured by environmental groups to
409	00:38:24.540	00:38:28.160	bring criminal -- Like Mr. Adler's? Exactly -- to bring criminal charges
410	00:38:28.170	00:38:31.620	in this particular case and they realize that if they
411	00:38:31.630	00:38:35.390	failed to do so, they would be charged with coddling
412	00:38:35.400	00:38:39.600	environmental polluters. Do you agree with that version of motivations
413	00:38:39.610	00:38:42.160	here? We did not bring any direct pressure on the
414	00:38:42.170	00:38:46.320	Justice Department to convene a grand jury. What you should
415	00:38:46.330	00:38:49.300	remember is that it was a grand jury of citizens
416	00:38:49.310	00:38:52.590	like you and me who decided that it was appropriate
417	00:38:52.600	00:38:55.300	to bring Exxon to justice. It was not due to
418	00:38:55.310	00:38:59.250	pressure from environmental groups. Let's talk about the message that
419	00:38:59.260	00:39:01.950	this indictment -- it will all come out in the wash
420	00:39:01.960	00:39:03.870	in the courtroom as to whether or not Exxon is
421	00:39:03.880	00:39:06.990	finally found guilty, but just the indictment, itself, what message
422	00:39:07.000	00:39:10.330	does that send to American business and industry, Mr. Adler?
423	00:39:10.340	00:39:14.050	The message, and an appropriate message at that, is that
424	00:39:14.060	00:39:17.780	we will not tolerate conduct that causes severe damage to
425	00:39:17.790	00:39:21.050	our natural resources. Is that a new message? That is
426	00:39:21.060	00:39:23.430	a new message in the magnitude. Again, there have been
427	00:39:23.440	00:39:28.000	other criminal indictments. We would encourage the Justice Department to
428	00:39:28.010	00:39:32.310	pursue this indictment aggressively, to send that message very forcefully.
429	00:39:32.320	00:39:34.560	What's your view of the message here? I would agree
430	00:39:34.570	00:39:36.620	that that's the message and I think it's an unfortunate
431	00:39:36.630	00:39:39.500	one. It seems to me that all of a sudden
432	00:39:39.510	00:39:44.730	in this country it's become fashionable to see environmental preservation
433	00:39:44.740	00:39:48.900	as the sole goal of issues that affect the environment.
434	00:39:48.910	00:39:50.820	I think that that's an admirable goal. I think that
435	00:39:50.830	00:39:53.830	preserving jobs is also an admirable goal. If we continue
436	00:39:53.840	00:39:59.320	to penalize American business the way that this administration appears
437	00:39:59.330	00:40:01.920	to be starting to do, we are simply not going
438	00:40:01.930	00:40:06.140	to continue to be competitive in the world market, and
439	00:40:06.150	00:40:08.750	it seems to me that the inevitable result is we're
440	00:40:08.760	00:40:11.350	going to be losing jobs in this country. Mr. Adler.
441	00:40:11.360	00:40:15.760	Well, let's be realistic here. Exxon Corporation posted major profits
442	00:40:15.770	00:40:19.270	last quarter despite the accident, despite the amount of money
443	00:40:19.280	00:40:21.090	it spent on the cleanup. We're not going to put
444	00:40:21.100	00:40:22.720	Exxon out of business, we're not going to put a
445	00:40:22.730	00:40:25.230	single person out of a job, but we will send
446	00:40:25.240	00:40:28.470	a message to the corporation and its shareholders that if
447	00:40:28.480	00:40:30.580	it wants to make a profit, it has to do
448	00:40:30.590	00:40:33.670	so by abiding the law. Do you agree, Mr. Samp,
449	00:40:33.680	00:40:36.460	do you agree with Mr. Adler that while this is
450	00:40:36.470	00:40:42.340	huge and its magnitude is still not precedent shattering, that
451	00:40:42.350	00:40:45.760	there have been similar cases brought, similar criminal cases brought
452	00:40:45.770	00:40:48.350	in environmental matters? There have been similar cases, most of
453	00:40:48.360	00:40:50.430	them have been in recent years, and that's what very
454	00:40:50.440	00:40:53.900	much worries me. I certainly agree with Mr. Adler that
455	00:40:53.910	00:40:55.630	Exxon is not going to be put out of business
456	00:40:55.640	00:40:58.160	by this particular case, but some of the companies who
457	00:40:58.170	00:41:01.440	are being charged criminally in recent years are being driven
458	00:41:01.450	00:41:03.740	out of business. There is a client of our organization
459	00:41:03.750	00:41:08.370	whose crime was removing rubbish from a dump, replacing the
460	00:41:08.380	00:41:11.680	holes with clean fill dirt, and he's now facing a
461	00:41:11.690	00:41:14.720	three year jail sentence for this and his auto repair
462	00:41:14.730	00:41:16.680	business is being closed down. And those are the kind
463	00:41:16.690	00:41:19.810	of cases that particularly worry me. Do those kinds of
464	00:41:19.820	00:41:21.810	cases worry you, Mr. Adler, that this thing could get
465	00:41:21.820	00:41:24.880	out of hand? What worries me is that despite many
466	00:41:24.890	00:41:28.780	years of civil enforcement of environmental laws we still have
467	00:41:28.790	00:41:32.590	widespread non-compliance. Let me give you an example. According to
468	00:41:32.600	00:41:35.870	the General Accounting Office, a recent study, four out of
469	00:41:35.880	00:41:40.210	every ten industries who discharge toxic waste into the nation's
470	00:41:40.220	00:41:45.130	sewer systems are violating their discharge permits despite civil compliance.
471	00:41:45.140	00:41:48.210	Obviously, we don't have enough deterrence, and without this sort
472	00:41:48.220	00:41:51.340	of action corporate America is not getting the message that
473	00:41:51.350	00:41:54.630	it has to comply with environmental laws. Do you think
474	00:41:54.640	00:41:57.170	this sends the new message though on those kinds of
475	00:41:57.180	00:42:00.490	cases as well? I think it does to all corporations
476	00:42:00.500	00:42:04.700	who are responsible for complying with pollution laws if pursued
477	00:42:04.710	00:42:08.070	aggressively. Your concern, Mr. Samp, is that it sends a
478	00:42:08.080	00:42:09.910	double message, it may send a message to the bad
479	00:42:09.920	00:42:11.960	guys, but it also sends the wrong message to the
480	00:42:11.970	00:42:14.700	good guys as well? Exactly, and it seems to me
481	00:42:14.710	00:42:18.730	that, as I stated before, that this is not a
482	00:42:18.740	00:42:21.510	reasonable environment in order to allow business to thrive in
483	00:42:21.520	00:42:25.000	this country, that I would certainly agree that there are
484	00:42:25.010	00:42:29.050	appropriate circumstances under which criminal law should be enforced. For
485	00:42:29.060	00:42:30.900	example, it seems to me that any company that goes
486	00:42:30.910	00:42:33.270	out in the middle of the night and takes drums
487	00:42:33.280	00:42:35.430	full of toxic waste and dumps them in a park
488	00:42:35.440	00:42:39.520	and does so knowingly and intentionally, that sort of corporation
489	00:42:39.530	00:42:41.780	ought to be indicted. But we're not talking about that
490	00:42:41.790	00:42:44.240	kind of case here. We're talking about a corporation which
491	00:42:44.250	00:42:47.820	had no intention of spilling any oil, did so, perhaps
492	00:42:47.830	00:42:50.050	through its own negligence, and now they're finding themselves in
493	00:42:50.060	00:42:53.370	a criminal court. All right. Mr. Samp, Mr. Adler, thank
494	00:42:53.380	00:43:04.430	you both for being with us. Thank you. Thank you.
495	00:43:04.440	00:43:07.590	Next tonight new facts and the new debate about medical
496	00:43:07.600	00:43:11.620	malpractice. A major study released today found that thousands of
497	00:43:11.630	00:43:15.260	hospital deaths and tens of thousands of injuries each year
498	00:43:15.270	00:43:18.700	are the result of negligence but that relatively few victims
499	00:43:18.710	00:43:22.960	ever file malpractice claims in courts. The study conducted by
500	00:43:22.970	00:43:26.930	Harvard researchers examined one state, New York, that drew conclusions
501	00:43:26.940	00:43:31.200	with implications for a malpractice insurance system nationally. The study
502	00:43:31.210	00:43:35.210	was based on New York hospital patients in 1984. It
503	00:43:35.220	00:43:41.480	found more than 27,000 patients were treated negligently in hospital,
504	00:43:41.490	00:43:46.540	6,630 deaths were due in part to negligence, but only
505	00:43:46.550	00:43:49.610	one in eight of the patients injured by negligence actually
506	00:43:49.620	00:43:54.480	sought compensation and filed malpractice claims. These figures fuel an
507	00:43:54.490	00:43:58.870	already heated debate over what can be done to cut
508	00:43:58.880	00:44:03.990	malpractice insurance costs and improve medical care. Pres. Bush spoke
509	00:44:04.000	00:44:06.970	last week to doctors at Johns Hopkins University about the
510	00:44:06.980	00:44:11.290	impact of malpractice lawsuits on medical care. And I ask
511	00:44:11.300	00:44:18.250	you today to avoid the understandable urge to practice defensive
512	00:44:18.260	00:44:24.900	medicine, where doctors fearing litigation too often dictate treatment that
513	00:44:24.910	00:44:29.150	is unnecessary, where the threat of lawsuits threatens the very
514	00:44:29.160	00:44:34.160	research that is so desperately needed to save lives, and
515	00:44:34.170	00:44:40.740	in return, we've got to restore common sense and fairness
516	00:44:40.750	00:44:46.350	to America's medical malpractice system. Restoring common sense to the
517	00:44:46.360	00:44:49.270	system is the subject of a proposal in this week's
518	00:44:49.280	00:44:52.590	New England Journal of Medicine. The article calls for implementing
519	00:44:52.600	00:44:56.670	a no fault malpractice insurance system. The no fault system
520	00:44:56.680	00:44:59.470	would take cases out of courtrooms and set up expert
521	00:44:59.480	00:45:03.260	panels to compensate victims. We turn now to reaction to
522	00:45:03.270	00:45:06.170	today's study and a debate over the no fault solution
523	00:45:06.180	00:45:09.820	proposal. Dr. David Axelrod is the New York State Commissioner
524	00:45:09.830	00:45:13.540	of Health. He commissioned the Harvard Report today and is
525	00:45:13.550	00:45:16.170	one of the leading proponents of the no fault insurance
526	00:45:16.180	00:45:20.930	solution. Harvey Wachsman is a physician and practicing lawyer. He
527	00:45:20.940	00:45:24.790	is president of the American Board of Professional Liability Attorneys.
528	00:45:24.800	00:45:27.140	He's on the faculty of Brooklyn Law School and the
529	00:45:27.150	00:45:31.780	University of South Florida College of Medicine. Dr. Axelrod, what
530	00:45:31.790	00:45:36.470	is the surprising finding in your study, the large amount
531	00:45:36.480	00:45:39.700	of negligence, or the small amount of claims? I think
532	00:45:39.710	00:45:42.310	it was rather the small amount of claims. A previous
533	00:45:42.320	00:45:46.740	study done at Stanford approximately 10 years ago identified roughly
534	00:45:46.750	00:45:50.290	the same percentage of adverse events, that is injuries to
535	00:45:50.300	00:45:54.020	patients that occurred that would lead us to have believed
536	00:45:54.030	00:45:57.140	at least that the number would be approximately the same.
537	00:45:57.150	00:45:59.620	There is a concern I have with the data that
538	00:45:59.630	00:46:01.640	are being presented and that is that this is an
539	00:46:01.650	00:46:05.530	extrapolation from the review of some 30,000 charts to over
540	00:46:05.540	00:46:10.340	2.7 million discharges in 1984. So to say that numbers
541	00:46:10.350	00:46:13.180	of thousands of individuals who are identified as having died
542	00:46:13.190	00:46:17.980	represents an extrapolation from 1,100 cases in which injury was
543	00:46:17.990	00:46:20.590	identified in the Harvard study. I see. It's like a
544	00:46:20.600	00:46:22.710	poll. In other words, you've taken a sample and you're
545	00:46:22.720	00:46:25.930	saying that represents that reality? That is correct. Right, like
546	00:46:25.940	00:46:30.010	a blood sample. Yes. Okay. Why do you believe there
547	00:46:30.020	00:46:34.520	are so few malpractice claims arising out of so many
548	00:46:34.530	00:46:37.580	cases of negligence? I think in many instances, the patient
549	00:46:37.590	00:46:39.710	is not aware of the fact that any negligence has
550	00:46:39.720	00:46:43.250	been committed. I think there are difficulties in accessing what
551	00:46:43.260	00:46:46.590	is otherwise identified as an officious system with respect to
552	00:46:46.600	00:46:50.340	the individual person. I don't think that the average person
553	00:46:50.350	00:46:53.890	believes that there is much chance of success. An individual
554	00:46:53.900	00:46:56.780	who comes from a lower socio-economic background may not feel
555	00:46:56.790	00:46:59.410	that he has the wherewithal or she has the wherewithal
556	00:46:59.420	00:47:04.160	to pursue a malpractice suit. There is no clear indication
557	00:47:04.170	00:47:07.290	that our system is geared to one of social responsibility
558	00:47:07.300	00:47:11.300	with respect to payment for medical injury and it leads
559	00:47:11.310	00:47:14.680	more to an event that looks like entering a lottery
560	00:47:14.690	00:47:18.750	with respect to a return with a medical malpractice suit.
561	00:47:18.760	00:47:24.290	Do you share Pres. Bush's belief that fear of malpractice
562	00:47:24.300	00:47:29.670	claims, that doctors hold of malpractice claims, is distorting the
563	00:47:29.680	00:47:32.570	medical delivery system? Yes, I believe that there is a
564	00:47:32.580	00:47:35.050	distortion which is occurring. I think it's occurring in a
565	00:47:35.060	00:47:38.270	number of different areas. The most important of them may,
566	00:47:38.280	00:47:41.200	in fact, be the unwillingness of physicians to participate in
567	00:47:41.210	00:47:45.110	peer review of their own colleagues. That fear I think
568	00:47:45.120	00:47:48.810	has removed an important element of maintaining the quality of
569	00:47:48.820	00:47:52.720	healthcare within our institutions. Without full participation of physicians, it
570	00:47:52.730	00:47:54.640	is not going to be possible to have a full
571	00:47:54.650	00:47:57.960	review of what happens and the manifestation of quality that
572	00:47:57.970	00:47:59.940	we would like to have. I do believe there is
573	00:47:59.950	00:48:03.210	a cost impact associated with the practice of defensive medicine.
574	00:48:03.220	00:48:05.280	I don't know what it is. It's been estimated to
575	00:48:05.290	00:48:07.670	be 5 percent or 10 percent or 15 percent in
576	00:48:07.680	00:48:11.460	various studies. How does that come about? Doctors because of
577	00:48:11.470	00:48:14.970	their concern for their ultimate testimony in the event that
578	00:48:14.980	00:48:17.720	they should be faced with a malpractice suit attempt to
579	00:48:17.730	00:48:19.970	go to the nth degree with respect to the ruling
580	00:48:19.980	00:48:23.110	out of diseases. There is an error of commission in
581	00:48:23.120	00:48:27.380	many instances with respect to reaching the 99.9 percentile in
582	00:48:27.390	00:48:30.220	terms of likelihood of a given disease by some very
583	00:48:30.230	00:48:35.060	expensive tests. We have a broad armamentarium of diagnostic tests,
584	00:48:35.070	00:48:36.610	evaluative procedures that are available to the evaluative procedures that
585	00:48:36.620	00:48:39.290	are available to the medical profession, and the physician may
586	00:48:39.300	00:48:42.210	choose to utilize one or many of them or all
587	00:48:42.220	00:48:44.830	of them in an effort to assure himself that he
588	00:48:44.840	00:48:47.290	is not going to be subject to litigation by virtue
589	00:48:47.300	00:48:50.790	of his failure to have done a single test. Okay.
590	00:48:50.800	00:48:53.890	We'll come back in a moment. Dr. Wachsman, do you
591	00:48:53.900	00:48:57.380	dispute the findings of the survey? I think the survey's
592	00:48:57.390	00:49:00.080	findings of enormous of amount of malpractice in this country
593	00:49:00.090	00:49:04.170	is true. I think that there are numbers of physicians
594	00:49:04.180	00:49:07.210	who are alcoholics, drug addicts, psychiatrically impaired. According to the
595	00:49:07.220	00:49:10.580	AMA 7 to 9 percent, or thirty to forty thousand
596	00:49:10.590	00:49:14.310	physicians in this country are impaired. Obviously, that would cause
597	00:49:14.320	00:49:17.070	an enormous amount of malpractice which does cut across this
598	00:49:17.080	00:49:20.000	country, and you extrapolate those numbers, that comes out to
599	00:49:20.010	00:49:23.810	about 100,000 people a year die because of malpractice in
600	00:49:23.820	00:49:26.730	hospitals alone. This was a study of hospitals, not even
601	00:49:26.740	00:49:30.300	doctors' offices, and hundreds of thousands of people are injured.
602	00:49:30.310	00:49:32.990	The reason for the great disparity between the numbers of
603	00:49:33.000	00:49:39.400	lawsuits and the numbers of malpractice is clear. It's due
604	00:49:39.410	00:49:43.260	to deception and fraud practiced by physicians and hospitals in
605	00:49:43.270	00:49:46.650	this country, misleading patients, so that they do not know,
606	00:49:46.660	00:49:50.560	and they are misrepresented to in a wholesale manner by
607	00:49:50.570	00:49:53.970	physicians so that they cannot find out what exactly occurred.
608	00:49:53.980	00:49:57.060	There's also changing of records, forgery that goes on on
609	00:49:57.070	00:50:00.630	a national level, that's as significant as well. But for
610	00:50:00.640	00:50:03.040	those patients who do find out and do know or
611	00:50:03.050	00:50:07.730	suspect there's been malpractice, Dr. Axelrod said they don't claim
612	00:50:07.740	00:50:10.800	because they think they're throwing themselves into a lottery. It's
613	00:50:10.810	00:50:14.650	not so. First of all, those people who are significantly
614	00:50:14.660	00:50:18.500	injured or, in fact, were injured, they win the cases
615	00:50:18.510	00:50:21.490	because they're meritorious. In our office, we just heard before
616	00:50:21.500	00:50:24.630	from Dr. Axelrod, there's very few wins by patients, not
617	00:50:24.640	00:50:27.290	so. In our office, more than 90 percent of the
618	00:50:27.300	00:50:29.620	patients who come to us, who we actually bring a
619	00:50:29.630	00:50:33.500	lawsuit for, we win, and although we only take about
620	00:50:33.510	00:50:37.520	3 percent of those patients who actually call or contact
621	00:50:37.530	00:50:40.300	our office in order to bring a suit. Do you
622	00:50:40.310	00:50:43.800	agree with Dr. Axelrod and the President that doctors fearing
623	00:50:43.810	00:50:47.880	malpractice are practicing defensive medicine and that that is raising
624	00:50:47.890	00:50:51.810	the cost of healthcare? That's absolutely untrue. That's something that
625	00:50:51.820	00:50:55.770	has been propagated by medicine and also obviously misled the
626	00:50:55.780	00:51:01.720	President into thinking that there is so much defensive medicine
627	00:51:01.730	00:51:06.220	going on. There is none essentially, because no test that
628	00:51:06.230	00:51:09.240	does not help a patient or at least find the
629	00:51:09.250	00:51:13.270	diagnosis or help elucidate the diagnosis for that patient in
630	00:51:13.280	00:51:16.410	no way assists the physician in defending himself. And the
631	00:51:16.420	00:51:18.760	truth of the matter is, that most malpractice is not
632	00:51:18.770	00:51:22.560	due to the 99 percentile test but is due to
633	00:51:22.570	00:51:25.830	three things, one, the physician not showing up, two, I'm
634	00:51:25.840	00:51:28.860	talking about seeing the patient and evaluating him rather than
635	00:51:28.870	00:51:31.580	over the phone or showing up some other time, two,
636	00:51:31.590	00:51:34.340	is not taking a proper history, which takes time to
637	00:51:34.350	00:51:37.330	evaluate a patient and 80 percent of diagnosis is made
638	00:51:37.340	00:51:40.360	on history, and three, is not doing a proper, a
639	00:51:40.370	00:51:44.020	physical examination. 70 percent of all malpractice cases across this
640	00:51:44.030	00:51:46.770	country are due to a physician not showing up, not
641	00:51:46.780	00:51:49.330	taking a proper history, examining, and if you look at
642	00:51:49.340	00:51:51.980	that, I think any patient is entitled to those things
643	00:51:51.990	00:51:55.490	and not due to some test that somehow he didn't
644	00:51:55.500	00:51:59.240	do. Those cases we have wide experience, we've written three
645	00:51:59.250	00:52:02.970	volumes in the area, it's not so. You say it's
646	00:52:02.980	00:52:06.830	not so, but you wouldn't agree with the cartoon, with
647	00:52:06.840	00:52:09.320	the sort of folk wisdom that's in the cartoon in
648	00:52:09.330	00:52:11.570	the New Yorker recently where a doctor is saying to
649	00:52:11.580	00:52:13.670	a patient, well, I think it's just a common cold,
650	00:52:13.680	00:52:15.760	but let's run a full battery of tests just to
651	00:52:15.770	00:52:18.560	be sure? No, because that's just not true. Again that's
652	00:52:18.570	00:52:20.760	misrepresentation. There have been a lot of things in history,
653	00:52:20.770	00:52:23.780	as you're aware of, that have occurred and knowledge that's
654	00:52:23.790	00:52:28.120	pushed around and stated when, in fact, it's not true.
655	00:52:28.130	00:52:31.790	The truth is that there is no great defensive medicine.
656	00:52:31.800	00:52:33.730	The only defensive medicine that does exist, which I do
657	00:52:33.740	00:52:36.630	agree with, is when a physician spends more time with
658	00:52:36.640	00:52:39.400	his patient, talks him and examines him over a longer
659	00:52:39.410	00:52:42.100	period of time, and, therefore, can see less patients per
660	00:52:42.110	00:52:45.120	hour and therefore, there's a cost to that physician because
661	00:52:45.130	00:52:47.530	he can't make as much money. But it's certainly not
662	00:52:47.540	00:52:49.900	due to tests. Two quite different points of view on
663	00:52:49.910	00:52:53.780	this. Now, you are in favor of replacing the present
664	00:52:53.790	00:52:56.670	system with a no fault system. Can you explain briefly
665	00:52:56.680	00:52:59.080	how that would work and why it would improve things,
666	00:52:59.090	00:53:01.650	in your view? I think the first difficulty is that
667	00:53:01.660	00:53:03.800	you've been talking about the Harvard study dealing with medical
668	00:53:03.810	00:53:06.920	malpractice. The Harvard study did not deal with medical malpractice.
669	00:53:06.930	00:53:09.670	The Harvard study dealt with medical injury and the nature
670	00:53:09.680	00:53:12.260	of that injury and the extent to which negligence was
671	00:53:12.270	00:53:16.420	responsible for that injury. Only 1 percent of the cases
672	00:53:16.430	00:53:20.620	that were reviewed by the Harvard study demonstrated negligence, so
673	00:53:20.630	00:53:23.070	that what we have tried to do is to define
674	00:53:23.080	00:53:25.940	our terms a little bit better. We are concerned with
675	00:53:25.950	00:53:28.460	a social system which provides justice to those who are
676	00:53:28.470	00:53:31.730	injured by virtue of their contact with the healthcare system.
677	00:53:31.740	00:53:34.670	Our concern is that the medical care system is a
678	00:53:34.680	00:53:37.360	hazardous one in terms of your entry into that system
679	00:53:37.370	00:53:39.590	because of the nature of the interventions, and that there
680	00:53:39.600	00:53:43.910	is a distinct possibility for injury. The no fault system
681	00:53:43.920	00:53:46.740	which we are proposing would have a mechanism by which
682	00:53:46.750	00:53:48.910	individuals would be paid on the basis of the nature
683	00:53:48.920	00:53:51.920	of that injury if there was causality established, rather than
684	00:53:51.930	00:53:54.740	fault assigned to a given physician. It would not be
685	00:53:54.750	00:53:57.900	necessary for an individual to become a plaintiff within an
686	00:53:57.910	00:54:01.840	adversarial system in order to be compensated for the injury
687	00:54:01.850	00:54:04.770	which occurred. Well, who would decide whether they were at
688	00:54:04.780	00:54:08.870	fault, the office or hospital -- It would presumably be a
689	00:54:08.880	00:54:11.240	panel of individuals who would be expert with respect to
690	00:54:11.250	00:54:14.170	the nature of those injuries, it would work similar to
691	00:54:14.180	00:54:18.120	worker's compensation where those who make decisions with respect to
692	00:54:18.130	00:54:21.410	occupational health would make a judgment. Why would that be
693	00:54:21.420	00:54:24.150	an improvement over the system now? Because as it currently
694	00:54:24.160	00:54:27.640	stands, the Harvard study demonstrates that only 1 in 10,
695	00:54:27.650	00:54:31.050	approximately 1 in 10 individuals, who have been injured as
696	00:54:31.060	00:54:34.360	a result of negligence ever receive any kind of compensation.
697	00:54:34.370	00:54:37.080	There is nothing to suggest that there is any equity,
698	00:54:37.090	00:54:39.850	that it's an effective system with respect to compensation for
699	00:54:39.860	00:54:41.910	medical injury. I think what we have to do is
700	00:54:41.920	00:54:44.320	to separate what it is we're trying to do. Are
701	00:54:44.330	00:54:48.450	we simply trying to provide a small number of individuals
702	00:54:48.460	00:54:50.570	that has no relationship to the nature of the injury?
703	00:54:50.580	00:54:52.590	In other words, big awards, millions of dollars? Big awards
704	00:54:52.600	00:54:55.690	as opposed to providing everyone who suffers an injury that
705	00:54:55.700	00:54:59.430	is significant with a level of compensation that is relevant
706	00:54:59.440	00:55:02.220	to the nature of that injury. Why wouldn't that be
707	00:55:02.230	00:55:04.390	an improvement on this system? I think first of all,
708	00:55:04.400	00:55:06.560	all it does is grant immunity and that's what they're
709	00:55:06.570	00:55:09.780	really interested in. The whole purpose of the study was
710	00:55:09.790	00:55:13.270	not to see to it how they can compensate people
711	00:55:13.280	00:55:16.690	better but to gain immunity. I can point to Virginia
712	00:55:16.700	00:55:19.660	and New Zealand which has no fault. In New Zealand,
713	00:55:19.670	00:55:24.910	since January 1, 1988, they have a brain damaged baby
714	00:55:24.920	00:55:27.430	circumstance -- No fault -- -- no fault system, and they're going to
715	00:55:27.440	00:55:30.530	compensate all these children, the total number of children in
716	00:55:30.540	00:55:33.060	two years and two months that have been compensated is
717	00:55:33.070	00:55:37.060	zero. In New Zealand, there's no fault system where a
718	00:55:37.070	00:55:40.550	patient has to prove their case to an official of
719	00:55:40.560	00:55:43.380	the government. That just doesn't occur, because they can't do
720	00:55:43.390	00:55:47.270	it. One little comment that Dr. Axelrod mentioned in passing
721	00:55:47.280	00:55:51.030	was the word "causation". The word "causation" means proximate cause
722	00:55:51.040	00:55:53.650	under the law. That is the most difficult thing for
723	00:55:53.660	00:55:57.110	a malpractice lawyer who's capable to prove in any case.
724	00:55:57.120	00:55:59.780	No patient will ever be able to prove it by
725	00:55:59.790	00:56:05.180	themselves. In other words, this is just giving the doctors
726	00:56:05.190	00:56:08.680	immunity because you'll never pay anybody because the doctors will
727	00:56:08.690	00:56:11.890	never admit if they review themselves or a committee reviews
728	00:56:11.900	00:56:14.200	them, they'll never admit that there was malpractice. But we've
729	00:56:14.210	00:56:18.090	confused two very different things. We've confused physician discipline and
730	00:56:18.100	00:56:22.670	deterrence with an equitable system for compensation for medical injury.
731	00:56:22.680	00:56:26.140	Both Dr. Wachsman and I would agree that there needs
732	00:56:26.150	00:56:29.490	to be a better disciplinary system. I do not believe
733	00:56:29.500	00:56:32.900	that there is any data that would suggest that the
734	00:56:32.910	00:56:36.250	existing malpractice system represents an effective deterrent. That was one
735	00:56:36.260	00:56:38.130	of the elements of the Harvard study and I think
736	00:56:38.140	00:56:41.290	that there is, if any presence of deterrence, it's very
737	00:56:41.300	00:56:43.710	limited. But his point is that the system you're proposing
738	00:56:43.720	00:56:46.210	would represent no deterrence at all. Oh, no, oh, no,
739	00:56:46.220	00:56:51.840	hardly. I mean, he instances no compensation for birth damaged
740	00:56:51.850	00:56:55.400	babies under the Virginia's no fault system and the inability
741	00:56:55.410	00:56:57.730	of patients in New Zealand under their system to gain
742	00:56:57.740	00:57:02.340	any admission of malpractice. Well, there's, I don't want to
743	00:57:02.350	00:57:04.520	get into other systems, because I think that there are
744	00:57:04.530	00:57:07.190	complexities about the New Zealand system which has been in
745	00:57:07.200	00:57:09.870	place for 15 years that, in fact, has not had
746	00:57:09.880	00:57:12.760	an effective deterrent system. The Virginia system has been in
747	00:57:12.770	00:57:14.510	place for one year in which there has been any
748	00:57:14.520	00:57:17.170	experience, and I don't know that that is an appropriate
749	00:57:17.180	00:57:19.820	time frame in which to judge the effectiveness of the
750	00:57:19.830	00:57:23.270	program. What I think you have to do is identify
751	00:57:23.280	00:57:25.840	the fact that we have not been as good as
752	00:57:25.850	00:57:27.840	we think we have been with respect to oversight of
753	00:57:27.850	00:57:30.360	physicians. I think that there needs to be a whole
754	00:57:30.370	00:57:33.550	new arena in which we evaluate the effectiveness of the
755	00:57:33.560	00:57:37.670	oversight of government, the failures of the existing physician peer
756	00:57:37.680	00:57:41.520	review process, the failures of the hospital review process, but
757	00:57:41.530	00:57:44.380	I think that the most important thing of all that
758	00:57:44.390	00:57:47.480	will challenge the effectiveness of any malpractice system, any no
759	00:57:47.490	00:57:50.350	fault system even, will be the new information that is
760	00:57:50.360	00:57:54.160	emerging. One of the major revolutions that has occurred is
761	00:57:54.170	00:57:58.100	the availability of information with respect to outcome, with respect
762	00:57:58.110	00:58:01.880	to procedures within institutions, procedures done by physicians. I am
763	00:58:01.890	00:58:05.020	firmly convinced that it is the public, it is the
764	00:58:05.030	00:58:08.850	advocacy of the public, it is the public requesting information
765	00:58:08.860	00:58:11.900	that is going to change the medical practice in the
766	00:58:11.910	00:58:16.210	most imaginative way possible. I'm sorry, gentlemen, but that is
767	00:58:16.220	00:58:18.230	the end of our time. Thank you both for joining
768	00:58:18.240	00:58:31.380	us. Again, the major stories of this Wednesday, Nicaragua's Sandinista
769	00:58:31.390	00:58:35.030	government declared a unilateral cease-fire in the war against the
770	00:58:35.040	00:58:39.050	contras. On the Newshour, Pres. Ortega said if the contras
771	00:58:39.060	00:58:41.990	refuse to disband, he will do what is needed to
772	00:58:42.000	00:58:46.570	defend his nation. And after five previous attempts, NASA successfully
773	00:58:46.580	00:58:50.220	launched the space shuttle Atlantis. Good night, Robin. Good night,
774	00:58:50.230	00:58:52.850	Jim. That's the Newshour tonight and we will be back
775	00:58:52.860	01:00:09.227	tomorrow night. I'm Robert MacNeil. Good night.
