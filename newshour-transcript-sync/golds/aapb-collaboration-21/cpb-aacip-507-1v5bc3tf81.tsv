1	00:02:05.570	00:02:08.570	Good evening. I'm Jim Lehrer. On the NewsHour tonight coverage
2	00:02:08.580	00:02:12.390	of the Salt Lake City Olympics investigation, some perspective on
3	00:02:12.400	00:02:16.540	this year of devastating storms and other natural disasters, a
4	00:02:16.550	00:02:19.830	report on the big layoffs at Boeing in Seattle, and
5	00:02:19.840	00:02:24.510	a conversation about Cambodia with veteran foreign correspondent Henry Kamm.
6	00:02:24.520	00:03:05.250	It all follows our summary of the news this Tuesday.
7	00:03:05.260	00:03:09.290	A special panel began its investigation today of charges bribes
8	00:03:09.300	00:03:13.930	helped Salt Lake City win the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.
9	00:03:13.940	00:03:17.660	The five-member commission was appointed by the U.S. Olympic Committee.
10	00:03:17.670	00:03:21.300	Past and present officials of Salt Lake City's effort acknowledged
11	00:03:21.310	00:03:25.890	they gave International Olympic Committee members gifts. College tuitions were
12	00:03:25.900	00:03:30.030	also paid for some relatives of IOC officials prior to
13	00:03:30.040	00:03:33.780	the site selection. Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell heads
14	00:03:33.790	00:03:36.460	the panel, which met today in Washington. He spoke to
15	00:03:36.470	00:03:41.000	reporters after the session. I don't know what the investigation
16	00:03:41.010	00:03:43.410	is going to turn up. I do know what the
17	00:03:43.420	00:03:46.330	allegations are. I do know what all of the press
18	00:03:46.340	00:03:51.070	reports have been, but I don't think that it would
19	00:03:51.080	00:03:54.770	be fair or wise for me or other members of
20	00:03:54.780	00:03:59.290	this commission to at this point assume what the facts
21	00:03:59.300	00:04:01.260	are going to be. We're going to look at it
22	00:04:01.270	00:04:03.810	with an open mind; we're going to be as thorough
23	00:04:03.820	00:04:06.760	as possible; we're going to try to be as fair
24	00:04:06.770	00:04:10.450	as possible; but we're not going to pre-judge it. Weâ€™ll
25	00:04:10.460	00:04:13.090	have more on this story right after the News Summary.
26	00:04:13.100	00:04:16.090	There was more bad weather in the Northwest today. Heavy
27	00:04:16.100	00:04:19.660	rains and melting snow triggered floods and mudslides in Oregon
28	00:04:19.670	00:04:23.850	and Washington. Coast Guard boats ferried stranded residents to safety
29	00:04:23.860	00:04:27.020	in Oregon. Flood warnings are up for parts of Washington
30	00:04:27.030	00:04:30.790	State. Forecasters are calling for more rain in the area.
31	00:04:30.800	00:04:34.410	In the Southeast thousands of homes and businesses remained without
32	00:04:34.420	00:04:38.400	power. Virginia's power company said it expects to restore electricity
33	00:04:38.410	00:04:41.380	to all of its customers by tomorrow. We'll review the
34	00:04:41.390	00:04:46.620	year's weather-related disasters later in the program tonight. Overseas today
35	00:04:46.630	00:04:50.070	four foreign tourists were killed in Yemen on the southern
36	00:04:50.080	00:04:53.800	tip of the Arabian peninsula. Government officials said the victims
37	00:04:53.810	00:04:57.220	and twelve other tourists had been taken captive by Islamic
38	00:04:57.230	00:05:01.780	extremists. Security troops stormed the kidnappers' hideout only after they
39	00:05:01.790	00:05:06.040	reportedly began shooting hostages. There were conflicting reports about the
40	00:05:06.050	00:05:10.070	nationalities of those killed. U.S. officials said one American was
41	00:05:10.080	00:05:14.280	seriously wounded. Two Chinese exiles living in the United States
42	00:05:14.290	00:05:17.130	were captured in China and have been sentenced to three
43	00:05:17.140	00:05:20.940	years at forced labor. The Chinese foreign ministry said today
44	00:05:20.950	00:05:24.010	the three slipped into China seven weeks ago, hiding in
45	00:05:24.020	00:05:26.940	a truck coming from Hong Kong. They were sentenced to
46	00:05:26.950	00:05:30.720	the maximum term the police can order without a trial.
47	00:05:30.730	00:05:33.580	Four other government critics received long prison terms in recent
48	00:05:33.590	00:05:38.180	weeks in a crackdown on dissent. In Cambodia today two
49	00:05:38.190	00:05:42.060	senior members of the Communist Khmer Rouge apologized for the
50	00:05:42.070	00:05:45.780	regime of their leader, Pol Pot, in the 1970s. They
51	00:05:45.790	00:05:49.690	asked their countrymen to let bygones be bygones. Both elders
52	00:05:49.700	00:05:52.550	of the Khmer Rouge rebel movement defected to the government
53	00:05:52.560	00:05:55.960	recently. Prime Minister Hun Sen said it might not be
54	00:05:55.970	00:05:58.690	in the national interest to now try them for the
55	00:05:58.700	00:06:02.830	death of some 1.7 million Cambodians in the 70s. One
56	00:06:02.840	00:06:14.320	of the defectors said this: Most of our compatriots understand
57	00:06:14.330	00:06:26.150	that we have much more problem to resolve at present
58	00:06:26.160	00:06:37.310	and in the future, and we have to forget the
59	00:06:37.320	00:06:41.900	past. Author and New York Times Correspondent Henry Kamm covered
60	00:06:41.910	00:06:45.700	the Khmer Rouge and Cambodia for many years. Terence Smith
61	00:06:45.710	00:06:48.970	has a conversation with him later in the program. The
62	00:06:48.980	00:06:52.830	House managers or prosecutors of President Clinton's impeachment trial met
63	00:06:52.840	00:06:56.850	today. The thirteen are Republican members of the House Judiciary
64	00:06:56.860	00:07:00.510	Committee chaired by Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois. One of
65	00:07:00.520	00:07:03.720	their jobs is to decide how to present impeachment evidence
66	00:07:03.730	00:07:06.920	to the Senate. They're expected to make that formal presentation
67	00:07:06.930	00:07:09.990	next week. At the White House today the President offered
68	00:07:10.000	00:07:14.070	a new initiative to increase penalties against child abusers. The
69	00:07:14.080	00:07:16.990	plan would redefine murder to include the death of a
70	00:07:17.000	00:07:21.300	child caused by a pattern of abuse and increase sentences
71	00:07:21.310	00:07:24.660	for those who commit crimes in the presence of children.
72	00:07:24.670	00:07:26.620	And that's it for the News Summary tonight. Now it's
73	00:07:26.630	00:07:29.530	on to the Salt Lake City Olympics story, the year
74	00:07:29.540	00:07:34.180	of devastating weather, the layoffs at Boeing, and a conversation
75	00:07:34.190	00:07:47.020	about Cambodia. Tom Bearden begins our coverage of the Olympics
76	00:07:47.030	00:07:51.450	story. Salt Lake City realized the fruits of years of
77	00:07:51.460	00:07:55.670	lobbying in June of 1995, when the International Olympic Committee
78	00:07:55.680	00:08:00.020	announced the host city for the 2002 Winter Games. The
79	00:08:00.030	00:08:06.460	International Olympic Committee has decided to award the organization of
80	00:08:06.470	00:08:12.460	the 19th Olympic Winter Games in 2002 to the city
81	00:08:12.470	00:08:17.400	of Salt Lake City. Salt Lake had been a first
82	00:08:17.410	00:08:20.810	ballot winner--beating out Quebec and cities in Sweden and
83	00:08:20.820	00:08:25.130	Switzerland. Jubilant officials and residents celebrated at a huge outdoor
84	00:08:25.140	00:08:31.220	rally. But in the last several weeks charges have been
85	00:08:31.230	00:08:34.700	leveled that Salt Lake City officials bribed Olympic officials to
86	00:08:34.710	00:08:38.390	get the games. Those officials have admitted giving four hundred
87	00:08:38.400	00:08:43.100	thousand dollars in college scholarships to thirteen beneficiaries, including six
88	00:08:43.110	00:08:47.250	relatives of IOC members. Other members received gifts and free
89	00:08:47.260	00:08:52.940	medical services. Four separate investigations are now underway. The IOC
90	00:08:52.950	00:08:55.790	has ordered an inquiry, so has the Ethics Committee of
91	00:08:55.800	00:08:59.510	the Salt Lake Organizing Group. Last week the U.S. Justice
92	00:08:59.520	00:09:02.500	Department began its own review on whether federal tax and
93	00:09:02.510	00:09:06.770	corruption laws were violated. And today, former US Senate Majority
94	00:09:06.780	00:09:09.760	Leader George Mitchell launched an investigation on behalf of the
95	00:09:09.770	00:09:13.420	United States Olympic Committee, He promised a "thorough and prompt"
96	00:09:13.430	00:09:19.940	investigation. I entered this process with a completely open mind
97	00:09:19.950	00:09:25.230	both as to the practices and standards which have been
98	00:09:25.240	00:09:28.740	utilized in the past and those which ought to be
99	00:09:28.750	00:09:34.380	utilized and part of our analysis and basis upon which
100	00:09:34.390	00:09:38.680	our recommendations will be made will necessarily involve looking at
101	00:09:38.690	00:09:42.090	what has happened in the past--what have been--if
102	00:09:42.100	00:09:45.860	any--the standards, written or otherwise--what have been the
103	00:09:45.870	00:09:53.030	actual practices; how have they either complied with or been
104	00:09:53.040	00:09:56.520	in violation of those guidelines. The very purpose of the
105	00:09:56.530	00:10:00.710	commission is to try to get the facts and to
106	00:10:00.720	00:10:03.770	put them in some context for the U.S. Olympic Committee
107	00:10:03.780	00:10:07.620	to try to help make certain that if, in fact,
108	00:10:07.630	00:10:12.290	there were practices in the past which were inappropriate, we
109	00:10:12.300	00:10:14.730	do everything we can to prevent them from occurring in
110	00:10:14.740	00:10:21.120	the future. The various Olympic committees looking into the matter
111	00:10:21.130	00:10:24.080	are scheduled to complete their investigations within the next couple
112	00:10:24.090	00:10:27.380	of months--well before the start of the 2002 winter
113	00:10:27.390	00:10:30.900	games. Now to two journalists who have been covering the
114	00:10:30.910	00:10:34.810	Olympic story: Howard Berkes of National Public Radio, and Christine
115	00:10:34.820	00:10:37.680	Brennan, who's also written two books on the Olympics and
116	00:10:37.690	00:10:41.820	figure skating. Okay, Christine, first of all, let's try to
117	00:10:41.830	00:10:47.780	understand some of the specific charges. College scholarships, these were
118	00:10:47.790	00:10:50.200	given to people who were on the International Olympic Committee.
119	00:10:50.210	00:10:52.360	Now how many people are on the committee, who actually
120	00:10:52.370	00:10:56.020	make these decisions? There are 115 members, and they're from
121	00:10:56.030	00:10:58.740	around the world, some of them are kings and queens
122	00:10:58.750	00:11:02.860	and princes, literally Princess Anne, Prince Albert of Monaco. There
123	00:11:02.870	00:11:06.720	are--I would call it actually the sports world's royal
124	00:11:06.730	00:11:09.730	family. This is about as upper crust as it gets.
125	00:11:09.740	00:11:11.930	And they make these decisions every few years to award
126	00:11:11.940	00:11:16.490	the Olympic Games to a city, winter or summer games.
127	00:11:16.500	00:11:18.510	And these are the people who make these decisions. And
128	00:11:18.520	00:11:20.720	these decisions are made way in advance, are they not?
129	00:11:20.730	00:11:24.550	That's correct. Seven/eight years in advance. For example, in 1988,
130	00:11:24.560	00:11:27.600	Atlanta received the nod from the US Olympic Committee, beating
131	00:11:27.610	00:11:30.390	out Minneapolis. Obviously, Atlanta then had to go at it
132	00:11:30.400	00:11:33.230	for a couple of more years against international competitors and
133	00:11:33.240	00:11:37.400	then in 1990, I believe it was 1990/1991, they received
134	00:11:37.410	00:11:41.160	the nod from the IOC in a secret ballot to
135	00:11:41.170	00:11:44.730	get the Olympics for 1996. Yes. Now, Howard, to you
136	00:11:44.740	00:11:48.760	on the specifics here in Salt Lake City. They are
137	00:11:48.770	00:11:52.780	accused of--the people in Salt Lake City are accused
138	00:11:52.790	00:11:56.260	of, for instance, providing college scholarships to some of these--
139	00:11:56.270	00:11:59.380	to relatives of members of the IOC. What's the nature
140	00:11:59.390	00:12:02.610	of those scholarships? Well, we don't have very many details
141	00:12:02.620	00:12:05.300	about that because the Salt Lake Olympic organizing committee still
142	00:12:05.310	00:12:09.040	has withheld much of the information about this program, but
143	00:12:09.050	00:12:12.420	what we do know is that over a period of
144	00:12:12.430	00:12:16.290	seven years Salt Lake Olympic organizers paid out thousands of
145	00:12:16.300	00:12:22.360	dollars in college scholarships to six relatives of IOC members;
146	00:12:22.370	00:12:24.850	they put them through school--through American University in the
147	00:12:24.860	00:12:29.240	case of the daughter of one IOC member, through several
148	00:12:29.250	00:12:35.230	colleges in Utah. The payments also included living expenses and
149	00:12:35.240	00:12:39.560	books, and other things that were necessary for them to
150	00:12:39.570	00:12:41.990	be in school. Now, there was also a very interesting
151	00:12:42.000	00:12:46.480	story about medical expenses that were provided for members of
152	00:12:46.490	00:12:50.250	the committee. Tell us that story. Well, at least three
153	00:12:50.260	00:12:53.970	people associated with the International Olympic Committee, either IOC members
154	00:12:53.980	00:12:59.760	or their relatives, received as much as $30,000 in free
155	00:12:59.770	00:13:04.080	medical care that was arranged by organizers of the Salt
156	00:13:04.090	00:13:10.760	Lake Olympics. There were--we know specifically of three instances--
157	00:13:10.770	00:13:14.050	again, we don't have the details on that--but in
158	00:13:14.060	00:13:18.300	one case somebody received some cosmetic surgery; in another case
159	00:13:18.310	00:13:22.540	some kind of operation on the knee or the thigh.
160	00:13:22.550	00:13:26.620	And Olympic organizers went to local hospitals and doctors and
161	00:13:26.630	00:13:29.460	said, for the sake of the Olympic bid we want
162	00:13:29.470	00:13:31.950	you to do this for free. And you're talking about
163	00:13:31.960	00:13:33.940	local, you mean in Salt Lake City? Here in Salt
164	00:13:33.950	00:13:36.020	Lake City. And they, in fact, did it? And they
165	00:13:36.030	00:13:39.050	did it. Yes. And they did it. Now, Christine, you've
166	00:13:39.060	00:13:42.010	been covering these Olympic stories for years. Is what Salt
167	00:13:42.020	00:13:44.810	Lake City did unique? I don't think so, and I
168	00:13:44.820	00:13:46.400	think that's one of the key issues here as we
169	00:13:46.410	00:13:48.440	look at this whole thing. I've covered the games since
170	00:13:48.450	00:13:52.260	1984, and really 1984 is the--is the watershed year,
171	00:13:52.270	00:13:55.820	when the Los Angeles Olympics succeeded as they did, and
172	00:13:55.830	00:13:59.370	you had this incredible big birthday party, celebration in the
173	00:13:59.380	00:14:02.150	United States. All of a sudden, after the disasters with
174	00:14:02.160	00:14:05.160	Munich, with the eleven Israeli athletes killed, and then with
175	00:14:05.170	00:14:07.700	Montreal and a deficit I think they're still paying for
176	00:14:07.710	00:14:10.080	now in Montreal, all of a sudden you have cities
177	00:14:10.090	00:14:13.510	falling over themselves wanting the Olympic games. And what happened
178	00:14:13.520	00:14:15.880	and what I've found over the years covering this is
179	00:14:15.890	00:14:18.890	that these kinds of things, perhaps not to this degree,
180	00:14:18.900	00:14:20.390	these kinds of things have been going on for quite
181	00:14:20.400	00:14:23.140	a while. For example, a man in Manchester who ran
182	00:14:23.150	00:14:25.640	the bid for Manchester, England, a bid that did not
183	00:14:25.650	00:14:29.270	succeed in the year 2000, told me and told others,
184	00:14:29.280	00:14:31.560	he said, he even knew the shoe size of the
185	00:14:31.570	00:14:35.540	second daughter of one particular IOC member. What does that
186	00:14:35.550	00:14:38.630	mean? That means they were giving out gifts constantly. You
187	00:14:38.640	00:14:42.950	had situations where IOC members were able to pilot yachts--
188	00:14:42.960	00:14:47.250	38-foot yachts in Sydney Harbour. Obviously, this was well within
189	00:14:47.260	00:14:50.320	the rules, so to speak, of the IOC--$200 gift
190	00:14:50.330	00:14:54.000	limit--but how do you rank priceless in the $200
191	00:14:54.010	00:14:56.650	gift limit area? And I think the reality is that
192	00:14:56.660	00:14:58.570	this has been going on for a long time, Jim.
193	00:14:58.580	00:15:01.300	I think--I don't think that Salt Lake City--while
194	00:15:01.310	00:15:03.600	it is important that we look at Salt Lake City--
195	00:15:03.610	00:15:06.440	they're going to say to a lot of people is
196	00:15:06.450	00:15:08.830	hey, we had to do this, and the IOC members
197	00:15:08.840	00:15:11.510	who were taking the gifts obviously didn't blow the whistle;
198	00:15:11.520	00:15:14.580	they took them. Yes. Howard, the attitude in Salt Lake
199	00:15:14.590	00:15:17.040	City--I was reading about this today and some people
200	00:15:17.050	00:15:19.660	were saying that Salt Lake City is actually a victim,
201	00:15:19.670	00:15:22.210	rather than a perpetrator of this system, is that--how
202	00:15:22.220	00:15:24.100	do you--is that how the people of Salt Lake
203	00:15:24.110	00:15:27.070	City see it? Well, actually, people in Salt Lake City
204	00:15:27.080	00:15:30.820	don't quite see it that way. Some people, of course,
205	00:15:30.830	00:15:34.560	here see that, as Christine described, that Salt Lake Olympic
206	00:15:34.570	00:15:38.300	organizers had to do what other bid cities have done
207	00:15:38.310	00:15:42.460	to win the games. Others, though, see it as Salt
208	00:15:42.470	00:15:48.340	Lake City taking the low road, and violating not only
209	00:15:48.350	00:15:51.580	the regulations of the International Olympic Committee that were in
210	00:15:51.590	00:15:55.250	effect at the time but possibly the law in order
211	00:15:55.260	00:15:59.040	to secure the games. What's important, though, at this moment
212	00:15:59.050	00:16:01.790	is that the International Olympic Committee and the US Olympic
213	00:16:01.800	00:16:05.510	Committee both have essentially said this is not Salt Lake
214	00:16:05.520	00:16:08.360	City's fault; the fault does lie within the members of
215	00:16:08.370	00:16:12.490	the International Olympic Committee who took it upon themselves to
216	00:16:12.500	00:16:15.360	extract these kinds of gifts, to encourage them over the
217	00:16:15.370	00:16:19.270	years, to seek them out. And it's quite clear that
218	00:16:19.280	00:16:21.940	the International Olympic Committee and the US Olympic Committee puts
219	00:16:21.950	00:16:24.140	the blame there and that the action that they will
220	00:16:24.150	00:16:27.920	take will be focused on the members of the International
221	00:16:27.930	00:16:32.200	Olympic Committee and establishing rules that will prevent this kind
222	00:16:32.210	00:16:34.440	of thing in the future from that standpoint. There doesn't
223	00:16:34.450	00:16:36.940	seem to be anyone interested in punishing Salt Lake City.
224	00:16:36.950	00:16:38.920	Yes. Christine, it would seem then that it would be
225	00:16:38.930	00:16:41.320	very easy to solve this problem if the people who
226	00:16:41.330	00:16:45.680	are taking the--whether they're bribes or favors--whatever they
227	00:16:45.690	00:16:49.010	are--just refuse to take them and discourage them, the
228	00:16:49.020	00:16:52.110	thing is over. Absolutely. And obviously the IOC has to
229	00:16:52.120	00:16:54.440	police itself, or at least that's what you would hope,
230	00:16:54.450	00:16:56.470	but they haven't. And, in fact, they've been having their
231	00:16:56.480	00:16:58.810	hands out saying give me more, give me more--golf
232	00:16:58.820	00:17:02.260	at Augusta National from the Atlanta people--again a legal
233	00:17:02.270	00:17:04.860	gift in that sense. I think what's going to have
234	00:17:04.870	00:17:08.150	to happen--What were you talking about there, the Augusta--
235	00:17:08.160	00:17:10.720	the people who on the IOC who were allowed to
236	00:17:10.730	00:17:13.760	play golf at the--At Augusta National--five members of
237	00:17:13.770	00:17:16.060	the IOC went and played golf at Augusta National, the
238	00:17:16.070	00:17:18.290	site of the masters, one of the hallowed grounds of
239	00:17:18.300	00:17:22.490	golf, as part of Atlanta's bid. At the time, Atlanta
240	00:17:22.500	00:17:24.900	was hoping that golf would be part of the Olympics,
241	00:17:24.910	00:17:27.200	and one of the reasons they allowed this to happen
242	00:17:27.210	00:17:28.760	is while they had to see the site, after all,
243	00:17:28.770	00:17:31.760	make sure all eighteen greens were up to Olympic standards.
244	00:17:31.770	00:17:33.950	Of course, golf was not in the Olympics. What kind
245	00:17:33.960	00:17:36.380	of perk is that? This again was legal. Atlanta was
246	00:17:36.390	00:17:38.550	doing nothing wrong, but I think the point that needs
247	00:17:38.560	00:17:41.050	to be made here is that Salt Lake City obviously,
248	00:17:41.060	00:17:43.720	if alleged--what is alleged is true--Salt Lake City
249	00:17:43.730	00:17:46.410	may have gone farther, but when you look at some
250	00:17:46.420	00:17:49.900	of the things the IOC was expecting, was wanting, I
251	00:17:49.910	00:17:52.340	would point my finger right at the IOC members, as
252	00:17:52.350	00:17:54.350	a journalist looking at this, and ask them the question,
253	00:17:54.360	00:17:57.750	why didn't you say, hey, we're getting this, we shouldn't
254	00:17:57.760	00:18:00.330	be getting this, and my sense of it is that
255	00:18:00.340	00:18:03.210	they cannot police themselves, but what we will see down
256	00:18:03.220	00:18:06.910	the road is a commission, perhaps ten, fifteen members, international--
257	00:18:06.920	00:18:09.740	an international body of people outside of the Olympic world
258	00:18:09.750	00:18:14.050	watching this very closely. What have the IOC members said,
259	00:18:14.060	00:18:16.380	themselves, about all of this, other than to appoint the
260	00:18:16.390	00:18:19.410	Mitchell Commission and other than that--and other things like
261	00:18:19.420	00:18:23.350	that--what have they said and done? Well, the individual
262	00:18:23.360	00:18:28.720	members of the IOC, some of whom have been accused,
263	00:18:28.730	00:18:32.270	deny the accusations. They're not saying much at all. The
264	00:18:32.280	00:18:35.460	International Olympic Committee, the executive board of the International Olympic
265	00:18:35.470	00:18:38.600	Committee, particularly Mark Hodler, who's the second most senior member
266	00:18:38.610	00:18:42.840	of the IOC, Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the
267	00:18:42.850	00:18:45.540	IOC, and Dick Pound, a vice president who's considered the
268	00:18:45.550	00:18:49.200	heir apparent to Juan Antonio Samaranch, they all have spoken
269	00:18:49.210	00:18:55.480	out. They generally have certainly condemned this kind of activity.
270	00:18:55.490	00:18:58.680	They have launched their own investigation. What they're interested in
271	00:18:58.690	00:19:01.950	doing it appears is taking away from the general membership
272	00:19:01.960	00:19:05.250	of the IOC those 115 members, the ability to choose
273	00:19:05.260	00:19:08.880	Olympic cities. They have talked about a process by which
274	00:19:08.890	00:19:12.270	that would be--the Olympic cities would be chosen by
275	00:19:12.280	00:19:16.660	the 11-member executive board. Juan Antonio Samaranch has tried this
276	00:19:16.670	00:19:21.060	before and the IOC has voted it down. This may
277	00:19:21.070	00:19:25.080	be the opportunity, though, with all the attention that is
278	00:19:25.090	00:19:28.210	now focused on this scandal for the IOC to finally
279	00:19:28.220	00:19:32.400	do this. And it may be a way certainly of
280	00:19:32.410	00:19:35.700	controlling corruption; it may also be a way of consolidating
281	00:19:35.710	00:19:40.120	power within the International Olympic Committee. It's a wieldy body
282	00:19:40.130	00:19:42.730	with 115 people from all over the world who come
283	00:19:42.740	00:19:45.420	from all kinds of cultures and who have different kinds
284	00:19:45.430	00:19:50.010	of expectations, and in some cultures, the kind of favors
285	00:19:50.020	00:19:53.500	that--exchange of favors that took place here is probably
286	00:19:53.510	00:19:56.530	not inappropriate at all. And not considered bribes. They're not
287	00:19:56.540	00:19:59.870	considered bribery. Part of the way that business is done
288	00:19:59.880	00:20:03.080	on an international level. I should point out that the
289	00:20:03.090	00:20:08.010	Justice Department is investigating. Sure. And there are federal laws
290	00:20:08.020	00:20:12.680	that do forbid this kind of activity; whether this particular
291	00:20:12.690	00:20:15.030	activity fits under those laws, that's what the Justice Department
292	00:20:15.040	00:20:18.210	is figuring out. But there are federal laws that prohibit
293	00:20:18.220	00:20:20.990	this kind of thing. Christine, what about the idea of
294	00:20:21.000	00:20:25.040	removing the decision making on where these games are from
295	00:20:25.050	00:20:27.390	that big--the big committee--and that might solve the
296	00:20:27.400	00:20:29.200	problem? I think that's a great idea, and obviously it
297	00:20:29.210	00:20:33.010	would also mean that the incredible dollar amounts--the estimated
298	00:20:33.020	00:20:35.320	thirty million dollars by the five or six cities going
299	00:20:35.330	00:20:38.060	for the 2000 Olympics. Thirty million dollars? Just to try
300	00:20:38.070	00:20:41.410	to win the bid that city, Sydney, Australia, eventually won--
301	00:20:41.420	00:20:44.160	$30 million--think where that money could go if they
302	00:20:44.170	00:20:47.010	weren't busy wining and dining the IOC members and of
303	00:20:47.020	00:20:50.300	course also building stadiums and beginning the process, but I
304	00:20:50.310	00:20:53.120	think that's a great idea. The fact is that do
305	00:20:53.130	00:20:55.520	all of these IOC members all have to go to
306	00:20:55.530	00:20:58.420	all these cities and get the expensive hotel suites and
307	00:20:58.430	00:21:00.930	go and play golf or do whatever they do, do
308	00:21:00.940	00:21:02.980	they all have to do this? It seems again like
309	00:21:02.990	00:21:05.400	it was Christmas morning every day of the year for
310	00:21:05.410	00:21:08.480	the International Olympic Committee and from the standpoint of this
311	00:21:08.490	00:21:10.580	opens the door and has us all look at it
312	00:21:10.590	00:21:13.320	a little bit closer, journalists, as well as obviously some
313	00:21:13.330	00:21:15.750	of the investigating bodies, that's probably a good thing. And
314	00:21:15.760	00:21:17.550	as they say about this time of the year, Christmas
315	00:21:17.560	00:21:20.200	may now be over. I think it is officially over
316	00:21:20.210	00:21:22.930	for the International Olympic Committee. Christine, Howard, thank you both
317	00:21:22.940	00:21:34.660	very much. Thank you, Jim. This bad year in weather
318	00:21:34.670	00:21:39.320	and to Phil Ponce. Mother Nature wreaked havoc across the
319	00:21:39.330	00:21:42.640	globe in 1998. Many experts call it one of the
320	00:21:42.650	00:21:47.280	worst years ever for weather disasters. Early this spring in
321	00:21:47.290	00:21:52.470	Indonesia and Malaysia, severe drought and dry, thinning rainforests caused
322	00:21:52.480	00:21:56.390	wildfires to spread. Hundreds of thousands of acres of forests
323	00:21:56.400	00:22:00.120	were blackened by the blaze and smoke covered the countryside,
324	00:22:00.130	00:22:05.680	prompting thousands of people to seek treatment for respiratory infections.
325	00:22:05.690	00:22:08.830	In Western India last June a cyclone swept a half
326	00:22:08.840	00:22:12.180	dozen villages in the western state of Gujarat into the
327	00:22:12.190	00:22:15.850	sea. More than a thousand people were killed. Winds up
328	00:22:15.860	00:22:19.730	to 65 miles per hour destroyed homes and cut communication
329	00:22:19.740	00:22:23.780	lines. A month later, a massive tidal wave in Papua
330	00:22:23.790	00:22:27.780	New Guinea killed at least two thousand people. A 23-foot
331	00:22:27.790	00:22:30.500	wall of water crashed into what used to be a
332	00:22:30.510	00:22:34.950	string of fishing villages in this Pacific nation. In August,
333	00:22:34.960	00:22:39.290	flooding on China's Yangtze River killed over three thousand people,
334	00:22:39.300	00:22:43.540	left fourteen million homeless, and devastated at least twelve million
335	00:22:43.550	00:22:48.210	acres of farmland. The price tag for China's worst flooding
336	00:22:48.220	00:22:51.920	in more than forty years is estimated at thirty billion
337	00:22:51.930	00:22:55.750	dollars. According to the World Watch Institute, that made it
338	00:22:55.760	00:22:59.720	the costliest disaster of 1998. But there was more flood
339	00:22:59.730	00:23:04.090	damage to come. Within weeks in Bangladesh, the rising Jamuna
340	00:23:04.100	00:23:07.360	River caused the worst flood in that area's history. For
341	00:23:07.370	00:23:11.780	two months two-thirds of Bangladesh was underwater; thirty million people
342	00:23:11.790	00:23:15.960	were forced to leave their homes. And this year, hurricanes
343	00:23:15.970	00:23:20.700	devastated countries in the Caribbean and Central America. Hurricane Georges'
344	00:23:20.710	00:23:24.560	high winds and torrential rains left a path of destruction
345	00:23:24.570	00:23:26.910	as it moved through both rich and poor areas of
346	00:23:26.920	00:23:32.280	the Caribbean, including St. Kitts & Nevis, Anguilla, Puerto Rico,
347	00:23:32.290	00:23:36.640	Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Cuba's eastern coast. It moved north
348	00:23:36.650	00:23:41.890	through the Florida Keys. But Hurricane Mitch was even bigger,
349	00:23:41.900	00:23:46.560	the most destructive natural disaster in Central America's modern history.
350	00:23:46.570	00:23:52.040	For five days torrential rains, flooding, and mudslides caused extensive
351	00:23:52.050	00:23:58.190	damage in Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico. Nearly
352	00:23:58.200	00:24:02.020	two million people were left homeless. In Honduras, officials said
353	00:24:02.030	00:24:06.400	the economy had been set back 25 years. Closer to
354	00:24:06.410	00:24:09.830	home, Canada and New England suffered from the worst ice
355	00:24:09.840	00:24:15.840	storm on record. The freezing rain and severe cold caused
356	00:24:15.850	00:24:18.940	at least thirty deaths and left close to one million
357	00:24:18.950	00:24:22.370	people without electricity. The cost for the damage reached more
358	00:24:22.380	00:24:26.930	than three billion dollars. Florida suffered when it was hit
359	00:24:26.940	00:24:30.500	with the deadliest round of tornadoes in history. Winds up
360	00:24:30.510	00:24:33.970	to 260 miles per hour battered the central part of
361	00:24:33.980	00:24:37.600	the state. At least 39 people were killed and hundreds
362	00:24:37.610	00:24:43.640	injured. Neighborhoods and shopping centers were turned to rubble. Then
363	00:24:43.650	00:24:47.800	last summer, with temperatures of more than 100 degrees, three
364	00:24:47.810	00:24:50.890	separate forest fires burned out of control in Florida for
365	00:24:50.900	00:24:54.960	weeks. Three hundred and fifty homes and businesses were destroyed,
366	00:24:54.970	00:24:59.750	an estimated 500,000 acres burned. Thirty thousand people were forced
367	00:24:59.760	00:25:06.440	to evacuate their homes. In September, Hurricane Bonnie, the first
368	00:25:06.450	00:25:09.540	hurricane of the season, damaged the Florida Keys before it
369	00:25:09.550	00:25:14.450	hit North Carolina, with 115 mile per hour winds. And
370	00:25:14.460	00:25:17.460	Mother Nature made her presence known through the holiday as
371	00:25:17.470	00:25:22.030	a pre-Christmas Eve ice storm froze the Southeast United States.
372	00:25:22.040	00:25:26.290	Virginia was especially hard hit. Today more than 50,000 Virginia
373	00:25:26.300	00:25:30.400	residents are still without heat or electricity. And in the
374	00:25:30.410	00:25:35.190	Northwest driving rain and melting snow resulted in massive flooding
375	00:25:35.200	00:25:38.600	and mudslides in Oregon and Washington State. It's the worst
376	00:25:38.610	00:25:43.020	flooding in the region since 1996. Joining me now are
377	00:25:43.030	00:25:47.270	Janet Abramovitz, senior researcher at the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental
378	00:25:47.280	00:25:51.380	research organization; Bob Watson, director of the Environment Department at
379	00:25:51.390	00:25:55.370	the World Bank; and John Clizbe, vice president of disaster
380	00:25:55.380	00:25:58.970	services at the American Red Cross. Welcome all. Ms. Abramovitz,
381	00:25:58.980	00:26:01.180	give us the big picture, in historical context, just how
382	00:26:01.190	00:26:06.160	bad a year was it? 1998 was a record-setting year
383	00:26:06.170	00:26:12.590	for economic losses from weather-related disasters. Storms, floods, fires, and
384	00:26:12.600	00:26:17.410	droughts caused at least $89 billion in damage worldwide this
385	00:26:17.420	00:26:21.670	year. And to put that into some perspective, that exceeds
386	00:26:21.680	00:26:26.850	the total for the entire decade of the 1980s. And
387	00:26:26.860	00:26:30.330	it's far higher than the last record-setting year, which was
388	00:26:30.340	00:26:33.660	only two years ago in 1996. And as far as
389	00:26:33.670	00:26:37.530	the--some of the disasters worldwide that come to mind,
390	00:26:37.540	00:26:41.120	which ones, in your opinion, were particularly significant? Well, I
391	00:26:41.130	00:26:46.950	think the lead-in story covered quite a lot of them.
392	00:26:46.960	00:26:51.140	Hurricane Mitch, the Yangtze River floods, flooding in Bangladesh, the
393	00:26:51.150	00:26:57.470	cyclones and floods in India, but it--this year, no
394	00:26:57.480	00:27:02.620	region was untouched. We also saw earlier in the year
395	00:27:02.630	00:27:06.480	massive forest fires in the wet tropical forests which had
396	00:27:06.490	00:27:11.610	never burned before--the fires in Indonesia, the fires in
397	00:27:11.620	00:27:16.210	Brazil, and Mexico. There have been so many of these
398	00:27:16.220	00:27:20.060	natural events this year that each one--we almost forget
399	00:27:20.070	00:27:23.620	about the last one because we're now--we're moving on
400	00:27:23.630	00:27:25.880	to deal with each and every one. So it's been
401	00:27:25.890	00:27:29.540	a record-setting year for economic losses and, of course, the
402	00:27:29.550	00:27:35.500	human devastation can't be underestimated either. Mr. Clizbe, in the
403	00:27:35.510	00:27:37.970	United States, what kind of a year was it in
404	00:27:37.980	00:27:40.810	historical terms? Well, unfortunately, it's a record-setting year in the
405	00:27:40.820	00:27:43.730	United States too. For the American Red Cross it was
406	00:27:43.740	00:27:47.400	easily our most demanding and literally our most expensive year
407	00:27:47.410	00:27:52.490	in our 117-year history, including a period of time, a
408	00:27:52.500	00:27:55.410	six-week stretch or so, in September or October or whatever
409	00:27:55.420	00:27:59.230	we're dealing with, more large scale disasters simultaneously than we
410	00:27:59.240	00:28:02.050	had ever faced in our history at the same time.
411	00:28:02.060	00:28:04.640	And when you say most expensive, was there one disaster
412	00:28:04.650	00:28:08.500	that was particularly costly? Certainly. Hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico--
413	00:28:08.510	00:28:13.210	particular the Puerto Rico portion of Hurricane Georges was the
414	00:28:13.220	00:28:16.330	most expensive disaster in American Red Cross history. And why
415	00:28:16.340	00:28:20.060	was it so expensive? Well, it was a very devastating
416	00:28:20.070	00:28:25.320	storm; it really hit Puerto Rico hard, and most of
417	00:28:25.330	00:28:28.630	the island was hit, and much of the inner part
418	00:28:28.640	00:28:31.350	of the island, up in the mountains and the communities
419	00:28:31.360	00:28:33.920	that sort of slid down the side of the mountains,
420	00:28:33.930	00:28:36.710	much like what we saw with Hurricane Mitch in Honduras
421	00:28:36.720	00:28:39.310	and Nicaragua, very similar kinds of things happened in Puerto
422	00:28:39.320	00:28:42.640	Rico. Mr. Watson, why was all this happening? Well, this
423	00:28:42.650	00:28:46.170	year was clearly the hottest year on record, and the
424	00:28:46.180	00:28:48.900	question is: Are these just natural events that occur every
425	00:28:48.910	00:28:52.430	so often, or is it possible that we humans are
426	00:28:52.440	00:28:55.950	slowly but surely changing the Earth's climate, and by changing
427	00:28:55.960	00:28:58.290	the Earth's climate, we are seeing more of these very
428	00:28:58.300	00:29:01.840	extreme events? And there was a lot of talk this
429	00:29:01.850	00:29:04.170	year, obviously, about El NiÃ±o. I mean, at some point
430	00:29:04.180	00:29:08.320	people seemed El NiÃ±o'd out. But a way to connect the
431	00:29:08.330	00:29:11.900	dots, using that? Well, the El NiÃ±o that we saw
432	00:29:11.910	00:29:13.290	at the end of last year and the beginning of
433	00:29:13.300	00:29:16.270	this year, it was clearly the most major El NiÃ±o
434	00:29:16.280	00:29:19.460	of the last 150 years. It caused the massive floods
435	00:29:19.470	00:29:23.050	in Peru, the droughts in Indonesia, but when--by the
436	00:29:23.060	00:29:25.510	time we got to the very large floods in China
437	00:29:25.520	00:29:27.810	and Bangladesh, they were not due to the El NiÃ±o
438	00:29:27.820	00:29:31.320	event. What happened was we got some very, very unusual
439	00:29:31.330	00:29:33.270	events where in parts of the Yangtze River we had
440	00:29:33.280	00:29:36.090	seventy inches of rain in June and July, where you
441	00:29:36.100	00:29:39.550	normally only get about ten or twelve. Bangladesh, two-thirds of
442	00:29:39.560	00:29:42.200	Bangladesh was swamped. In a typical day one was getting
443	00:29:42.210	00:29:45.230	five to ten inches of rain. And so we know
444	00:29:45.240	00:29:47.010	that if you get a warmer world, there will be
445	00:29:47.020	00:29:50.450	more very, very heavy precipitation events around the world, therefore,
446	00:29:50.460	00:29:52.670	more floods and more droughts. And so one of the
447	00:29:52.680	00:29:56.720	challenges is to find out if, indeed, we are changing
448	00:29:56.730	00:29:59.830	the atmospheric composition, greenhouse gas, will it lead to more
449	00:29:59.840	00:30:02.380	El NiÃ±o events, and, if so, we'll see more of
450	00:30:02.390	00:30:07.350	these drastic floods, drastic droughts, forest fires, et cetera, throughout
451	00:30:07.360	00:30:09.720	the world, unfortunately. And just a very quick reminder of
452	00:30:09.730	00:30:11.930	what El NiÃ±o was--it's the warming that happens occasionally
453	00:30:11.940	00:30:14.240	in the Pacific that warms the air and can cause
454	00:30:14.250	00:30:16.650	extremes in weather. That's right. It's the ocean off of
455	00:30:16.660	00:30:19.890	Peru and Ecuador warms up--last year, it was as
456	00:30:19.900	00:30:23.200	much as five degrees warmer than normal. And when that
457	00:30:23.210	00:30:27.160	happens, you change all the precipitation patterns around the world,
458	00:30:27.170	00:30:29.680	and especially in the tropics and subtropics. So, areas that
459	00:30:29.690	00:30:33.460	have gotten normally fairly dry become very, very dry. Peru
460	00:30:33.470	00:30:36.270	became extremely wet. And so what you see is very,
461	00:30:36.280	00:30:40.320	very drastic changes in precipitation events, as well as temperature.
462	00:30:40.330	00:30:42.430	And without making this a debate about global warming, what
463	00:30:42.440	00:30:46.500	is the latest evidence on that? Well, there's no question--
464	00:30:46.510	00:30:49.370	we are changing the atmospheric composition of greenhouse gases--there's
465	00:30:49.380	00:30:52.800	no doubt that the Earth's surface temperature is warming. This
466	00:30:52.810	00:30:55.370	year is probably the warmest year on record. Last year
467	00:30:55.380	00:30:57.730	was the previous warmest, and so the question is, the
468	00:30:57.740	00:31:01.410	bulk of scientists do believe that we humans are slowly
469	00:31:01.420	00:31:04.520	but surely changing the Earth's climate, and this could have
470	00:31:04.530	00:31:08.700	profound effects on agricultural productivity, sea level rise, and on
471	00:31:08.710	00:31:13.680	natural ecological systems. Ms. Abramovitz, going back to the events
472	00:31:13.690	00:31:16.970	of this year, the weather was the natural event, but
473	00:31:16.980	00:31:20.170	were there things that humans did that sort of exacerbated
474	00:31:20.180	00:31:23.220	things? Yes, absolutely. I think we can see the hands
475	00:31:23.230	00:31:26.200	of man in many of these disasters. Hurricane Mitch, for
476	00:31:26.210	00:31:31.330	example, hit a region that was ecologically and socially very
477	00:31:31.340	00:31:36.270	vulnerable. Honduras, for example, has lost two-thirds of its forest
478	00:31:36.280	00:31:40.620	cover, including much of the forest cover in the Tegucigalpa
479	00:31:40.630	00:31:44.320	watershed, and Central America has some of the highest rates
480	00:31:44.330	00:31:48.200	of deforestation in the world, likewise in the Yangtze River
481	00:31:48.210	00:31:52.420	Basin; 85 percent of the forests have been lost, the
482	00:31:52.430	00:31:55.590	lakes, the wetlands have been lost, and the rivers heavily
483	00:31:55.600	00:32:01.290	dammed, and what happens is that without tree cover to
484	00:32:01.300	00:32:06.690	hold the soil in place, when the rains come, they
485	00:32:06.700	00:32:10.190	can't be absorbed into the land, and they go racing
486	00:32:10.200	00:32:14.620	across the land, carrying mud and debris with it, filling
487	00:32:14.630	00:32:18.740	up the rivers, gaining force as they go downstream, particularly
488	00:32:18.750	00:32:21.960	when rivers are constricted, as many of the rivers in
489	00:32:21.970	00:32:25.760	the world now are, and you have these sorts of
490	00:32:25.770	00:32:31.340	events. On top of that, people are also settling in
491	00:32:31.350	00:32:36.330	vulnerable areas, in coastal areas, in river flood plains, on
492	00:32:36.340	00:32:41.830	steep hillsides, and so more people are in harm's way,
493	00:32:41.840	00:32:46.940	and there's more harm to be done because of land
494	00:32:46.950	00:32:52.020	use changes that have made the planet less resilient to
495	00:32:52.030	00:32:56.550	withstanding these kinds of natural disasters. So, we've turned what
496	00:32:56.560	00:33:00.210	would otherwise be a natural disaster into something--I mean,
497	00:33:00.220	00:33:02.600	Mitch would have been horrible notwithstanding any of those things
498	00:33:02.610	00:33:03.650	that you described. Absolutely. Absolutely. But when you have a
499	00:33:03.660	00:33:06.980	foot or two of rain every day, it's going to
500	00:33:06.990	00:33:10.770	be a bad situation. But if you have bare hillsides
501	00:33:10.780	00:33:13.410	and people living on bare hillsides, it's going to be
502	00:33:13.420	00:33:18.770	a decidedly unnatural disaster. And I think we're in for
503	00:33:18.780	00:33:21.130	more of these sorts of things in the future if
504	00:33:21.140	00:33:25.290	we continue down the same path. Now, luckily, some governments
505	00:33:25.300	00:33:29.340	have begun to recognize this. The Chinese government early in
506	00:33:29.350	00:33:33.780	the Yangtze River flood said, no, this is a completely
507	00:33:33.790	00:33:39.440	natural disaster. Later, they changed their story, and--and admitted,
508	00:33:39.450	00:33:42.920	in fact, that it did have a large measure to
509	00:33:42.930	00:33:47.180	do with deforestation, and then enacted a logging ban and
510	00:33:47.190	00:33:50.380	have begun reforestation efforts. Mr. Clizby, in this country have
511	00:33:50.390	00:33:54.520	people learned some lessons from what happened? Some. But probably
512	00:33:54.530	00:33:57.590	not enough. The American people have, bless their hearts, have
513	00:33:57.600	00:34:01.980	a propensity for living in disaster-prone areas. For example--Well,
514	00:34:01.990	00:34:05.750	about forty million people in the United States live in
515	00:34:05.760	00:34:10.780	high-risk disaster areas, in earthquake-prone areas along the Southeastern coasts
516	00:34:10.790	00:34:15.670	that are hurricane prone, so we're very vulnerable, and that
517	00:34:15.680	00:34:19.760	certainly showed itself this year. Many, not all, but many
518	00:34:19.770	00:34:23.290	of the significant disasters that happened this year were, in
519	00:34:23.300	00:34:27.150	fact, in areas that are disaster-prone, and we know it.
520	00:34:27.160	00:34:29.800	Would you put the flooding that took place in Texas--
521	00:34:29.810	00:34:33.150	Del Rio area in that category? Well, I think that
522	00:34:33.160	00:34:36.560	was a surprise, I think, to many of the people
523	00:34:36.570	00:34:40.990	in Texas. But Texas experienced severe floods this year, and
524	00:34:41.000	00:34:43.160	I think in Del Rio felt that they were living
525	00:34:43.170	00:34:46.830	in a safe area. It was a torrential rain and
526	00:34:46.840	00:34:51.890	a flash flood that just caused unspeakable devastation very, very
527	00:34:51.900	00:34:56.530	suddenly, but I think certainly--I think something like 80%
528	00:34:56.540	00:34:59.390	of the population of Florida lives within twenty miles of
529	00:34:59.400	00:35:03.720	a coast, so certainly Floridians are in vulnerable locations; all
530	00:35:03.730	00:35:07.890	along the southeastern part of the United States, there's vulnerability.
531	00:35:07.900	00:35:10.460	On the other hand, I think people are learning--in
532	00:35:10.470	00:35:15.600	the United States there are decreasing numbers of deaths with
533	00:35:15.610	00:35:18.020	disasters, and I think it's because we are getting better
534	00:35:18.030	00:35:22.220	at mitigating to some degree; people are learning some lessons;
535	00:35:22.230	00:35:24.730	and the Red Cross has found one of the things
536	00:35:24.740	00:35:27.490	we've learned is we need to start working with communities
537	00:35:27.500	00:35:30.510	and families to help them prepare so that they can
538	00:35:30.520	00:35:34.390	head off some disasters better. Now, you actually make visits
539	00:35:34.400	00:35:38.060	to places where disasters happen. What are the images that
540	00:35:38.070	00:35:40.030	will stay with you from this year? What things come
541	00:35:40.040	00:35:42.750	to mind? I think for all the statistics, I think
542	00:35:42.760	00:35:46.220	what really strikes me increasingly is that every disaster is
543	00:35:46.230	00:35:49.530	a personal disaster for a family or individual. If it's
544	00:35:49.540	00:35:52.080	a single family in the middle of Kansas with a
545	00:35:52.090	00:35:55.360	tornado or homes sliding off a side of a hill
546	00:35:55.370	00:35:58.410	in Puerto Rico or whatever, it really boils down to
547	00:35:58.420	00:36:03.650	people being hurt. And I think the emotional devastation, the
548	00:36:03.660	00:36:06.900	emotional toll is often as great as the physical toll,
549	00:36:06.910	00:36:12.200	and I can vividly picture--in Spencer, South Dakota, two
550	00:36:12.210	00:36:16.020	things strike me: one, a community totally wiped out as
551	00:36:16.030	00:36:18.980	if the tornado decided to come down to hit that
552	00:36:18.990	00:36:21.150	six- or seven-square block area and then lift off the
553	00:36:21.160	00:36:24.660	ground again. And at the same time, I remember seeing
554	00:36:24.670	00:36:27.450	two men sitting on a pile of rubble with their
555	00:36:27.460	00:36:32.490	arms around each other, obviously suffering with what they've gone
556	00:36:32.500	00:36:37.300	through. Del Rio, that you mentioned, I can remember seeing
557	00:36:37.310	00:36:42.370	the families that were impacted by what had been--what
558	00:36:42.380	00:36:46.560	had just suddenly come upon them in a very unpredictable
559	00:36:46.570	00:36:51.210	kind of way, or the families in Florida, and Alabama
560	00:36:51.220	00:36:54.320	and Georgia, that went through the tornadoes that were there.
561	00:36:54.330	00:36:59.100	I think it's--sometimes I think we can get preoccupied--
562	00:36:59.110	00:37:02.000	I can get preoccupied with sort of the numbers and
563	00:37:02.010	00:37:05.410	the scales and the scope and--it's been a major
564	00:37:05.420	00:37:08.280	challenge for us and the Red Cross, but I think
565	00:37:08.290	00:37:10.540	what strikes us we have to keep getting better and
566	00:37:10.550	00:37:15.690	better at working and serving individual families and people. Mr.
567	00:37:15.700	00:37:18.270	Watson, how about in parts of the world where the
568	00:37:18.280	00:37:20.350	resources might not exist that exist in the United States,
569	00:37:20.360	00:37:22.480	is there--if there is a will, are there the
570	00:37:22.490	00:37:26.370	means to sort of make better--build better buildings, build
571	00:37:26.380	00:37:29.120	communities out of harm's way? Our challenge now is to
572	00:37:29.130	00:37:33.630	help prepare developing countries for these natural disasters. Too often
573	00:37:33.640	00:37:37.010	we respond to a natural disaster. But we're making major
574	00:37:37.020	00:37:39.920	progress in how to predict hurricanes. That's why we don't
575	00:37:39.930	00:37:41.660	see the loss of life in the U.S. We have
576	00:37:41.670	00:37:44.360	to use that same technology in developing countries. But even
577	00:37:44.370	00:37:47.070	more with El NiÃ±o, we can now forecast six to
578	00:37:47.080	00:37:49.100	nine months in advance when we're going to see an
579	00:37:49.110	00:37:52.060	El NiÃ±o. So we can help to reduce the human
580	00:37:52.070	00:37:54.670	devastation. If it's going to be drier in some areas,
581	00:37:54.680	00:37:57.690	we can help the farmers decide what plants to crop.
582	00:37:57.700	00:37:59.030	If it's going to be drier, we can work with
583	00:37:59.040	00:38:01.740	the water resource managers, so we don't see these massive
584	00:38:01.750	00:38:04.560	hunger and famine events that we're seeing. If it's going
585	00:38:04.570	00:38:06.680	to become very wet, we are going to work with
586	00:38:06.690	00:38:09.580	the farmers, work with the water managers. In addition, we
587	00:38:09.590	00:38:13.250	can also work with the infrastructure, better roads, better bridges,
588	00:38:13.260	00:38:16.380	to reduce this threat, so I believe science is moving
589	00:38:16.390	00:38:19.660	us in a direction where while we cannot avoid the
590	00:38:19.670	00:38:22.710	disaster, we can be better prepared, we can reduce some
591	00:38:22.720	00:38:25.270	of the human misery, and some of the economic costs,
592	00:38:25.280	00:38:27.200	and the World Bank is working with many of our
593	00:38:27.210	00:38:29.790	client countries, and we want to be there before the
594	00:38:29.800	00:38:32.470	event, rather than after the event. And at this point,
595	00:38:32.480	00:38:35.700	very quickly, the ability to predict? As I say, hurricanes
596	00:38:35.710	00:38:38.130	we can predict very well now. We have to use
597	00:38:38.140	00:38:41.680	that same technology for other countries, such as Bangladesh, India,
598	00:38:41.690	00:38:44.450	China, and we can predict the El NiÃ±o event, which
599	00:38:44.460	00:38:48.160	is precipitation, mainly changes, drier or wetter, probably six to
600	00:38:48.170	00:38:49.950	nine months in advance. Well, that's all the time we
601	00:38:49.960	00:38:52.780	have. I thank you all very much. Still to come
602	00:38:52.790	00:38:56.320	on the NewsHour tonight, the layoffs at Boeing and a
603	00:38:56.330	00:39:11.310	conversation about Cambodia. Rod Minott of KCTS-Seattle reports the Boeing
604	00:39:11.320	00:39:15.620	story. In early December, Boeing made the stunning announcement that
605	00:39:15.630	00:39:19.810	it would eliminate 48,000 jobs over the next two years.
606	00:39:19.820	00:39:22.230	That's twenty thousand more than what the company had said
607	00:39:22.240	00:39:25.010	it would cut last summer. The loss of jobs will
608	00:39:25.020	00:39:29.120	reduce Boeing's work force by twenty percent. Workers coming off
609	00:39:29.130	00:39:32.660	the day shift at the 737 plant near Seattle blamed
610	00:39:32.670	00:39:36.120	senior management for causing the layoffs. They're supposed to be
611	00:39:36.130	00:39:40.050	getting six figures a year. They're supposed to be planning
612	00:39:40.060	00:39:43.570	ahead fifteen years. What the hell did they do? So
613	00:39:43.580	00:39:45.300	who gets to keep their job? The guys at the
614	00:39:45.310	00:39:47.220	top get to keep their jobs, the guys at the
615	00:39:47.230	00:39:50.980	bottom, we go out. Machinist Anthony Carson said the news
616	00:39:50.990	00:39:55.330	hit workers hard. Morale is like--it's kind of--it's
617	00:39:55.340	00:39:57.930	very low at this point--it's very low, because you
618	00:39:57.940	00:39:59.130	don't know if you're going to have your job the
619	00:39:59.140	00:40:03.800	next day so your clarity is gone, so it's kind
620	00:40:03.810	00:40:06.070	of tricky at this point because people are trying to
621	00:40:06.080	00:40:08.800	base things off a day-to-day life and that's kind of
622	00:40:08.810	00:40:11.340	hard to do when you have a house payment and
623	00:40:11.350	00:40:14.540	have a car payment. Boeing management blames the layoffs on
624	00:40:14.550	00:40:18.440	the economic crisis in Asia. Alan Mulally heads the commercial
625	00:40:18.450	00:40:24.280	airplane division. Approximately 25, 28 percent of our total airplane
626	00:40:24.290	00:40:28.140	production output goes to Asia, and so the concern that
627	00:40:28.150	00:40:32.720	we have, of course, is that our production looks very
628	00:40:32.730	00:40:37.440	solid for 1999, but this worsening situation of the economies
629	00:40:37.450	00:40:42.790	in Asia will decrease the need for new airplanes, especially
630	00:40:42.800	00:40:46.480	in the year 2000 and 2001. The economic turmoil has
631	00:40:46.490	00:40:50.080	caused many Asian airlines to cancel or delay plane orders
632	00:40:50.090	00:40:53.980	from Boeing. Jin Cho is with Asiana, a South Korean
633	00:40:53.990	00:40:57.900	airline that recently cut back its Boeing 747 flights from
634	00:40:57.910	00:41:00.870	Seattle to Seoul. Yes, we have been cutting back on
635	00:41:00.880	00:41:05.000	flight schedules because we sold off a couple of planes
636	00:41:05.010	00:41:10.960	to reduce the, I think, short-term debt to make our
637	00:41:10.970	00:41:15.640	accounting book a little better. Most of the production cuts
638	00:41:15.650	00:41:20.730	will hit the 747 jumbo jet, Boeing's most profitable plane.
639	00:41:20.740	00:41:24.370	The company plans to reduce production from about three 747
640	00:41:24.380	00:41:26.650	planes a month to two at the end of next
641	00:41:26.660	00:41:31.450	year. Manufacturing could drop as low as one 747 every
642	00:41:31.460	00:41:37.390	month in the year 2000 if market conditions worsen. Airline
643	00:41:37.400	00:41:41.140	industry analysts say both Boeing managers and the Asian crisis
644	00:41:41.150	00:41:44.170	are to blame for the company's woes. Some also cite
645	00:41:44.180	00:41:49.030	fierce competition with AirBus, the European consortium that also manufacturers
646	00:41:49.040	00:41:54.050	commercial jets. According to University of Washington economist Charles Hill,
647	00:41:54.060	00:41:57.970	aggressive rivalry with AirBus led Boeing to seek record sales
648	00:41:57.980	00:42:01.410	at unprofitable prices. They have this notion that they have
649	00:42:01.420	00:42:03.890	a God-given sixty percent of the market and they were
650	00:42:03.900	00:42:05.850	going to get that sixty percent of the market, whatever
651	00:42:05.860	00:42:07.940	it took, and if that took deep discounts on the
652	00:42:07.950	00:42:09.600	prices of planes, they were going to do it, if
653	00:42:09.610	00:42:12.110	that took accelerated deliveries, they were going to do it.
654	00:42:12.120	00:42:16.070	The aggressive marketing paid off. Boeing doubled its production within
655	00:42:16.080	00:42:19.370	the last two years. But Hill says the company wasn't
656	00:42:19.380	00:42:22.750	equipped to handle it all. Some customers complained of delayed
657	00:42:22.760	00:42:27.420	deliveries and even poor workmanship on jets. So they basically
658	00:42:27.430	00:42:30.320	met their delivery schedule by hiring far more people than
659	00:42:30.330	00:42:32.830	they historically would have done, but as a result of
660	00:42:32.840	00:42:35.420	aggressively going after market share, they suddenly found they had
661	00:42:35.430	00:42:37.390	to produce far more planes than they thought they would
662	00:42:37.400	00:42:40.040	have to do in a very short space of time,
663	00:42:40.050	00:42:44.660	before they'd fully implemented their manufacturing process improvements. Tim Goree
664	00:42:44.670	00:42:46.970	was one of those workers brought on to help Boeing
665	00:42:46.980	00:42:50.850	get through its production crunch. Last September, he'd been hired
666	00:42:50.860	00:42:54.770	to help assemble wings on the new 777 wide-body jet.
667	00:42:54.780	00:42:57.320	With no seniority, he was laid off after working at
668	00:42:57.330	00:43:05.480	Boeing for only three months. I was shocked. The main
669	00:43:05.490	00:43:07.380	thing going through my mind was what are we going
670	00:43:07.390	00:43:10.260	to do for the bills. Well, I heard rumors before
671	00:43:10.270	00:43:12.280	we actually got our warn notices, but I really didn't
672	00:43:12.290	00:43:13.690	think that I was going to be affected in the
673	00:43:13.700	00:43:16.750	first round. Goree claims Boeing told him that he would
674	00:43:16.760	00:43:19.650	have a job for at least two years. Now he
675	00:43:19.660	00:43:23.930	worries how $360 in weekly jobless pay will cover his
676	00:43:23.940	00:43:29.040	family's expenses. We're not financially set. You know, we don't
677	00:43:29.050	00:43:32.710	have a savings account. We've been living week to week,
678	00:43:32.720	00:43:37.240	you know, paycheck to paycheck, and four kids and a
679	00:43:37.250	00:43:40.100	house payment, and everything, it's pretty tough, you know, especially
680	00:43:40.110	00:43:42.740	now that I don't know where the money's going to
681	00:43:42.750	00:43:46.790	be coming from. Boeing says it's facing tough economic times
682	00:43:46.800	00:43:50.460	too. Its share of new orders for commercial aircraft has
683	00:43:50.470	00:43:53.320	shrunk to fifty percent in the face of competition with
684	00:43:53.330	00:43:56.780	AirBus. In addition, the aerospace giant had to deal with
685	00:43:56.790	00:44:01.130	the economics of a huge merger with McDonnell-Douglas last year.
686	00:44:01.140	00:44:04.120	The company also posted its first annual loss in fifty
687	00:44:04.130	00:44:08.760	years in 1997. Economist Hill says Boeing has to become
688	00:44:08.770	00:44:12.110	more efficient in order to become more profitable. If you
689	00:44:12.120	00:44:16.560	look at productivity at AirBus, it takes 143 employees to
690	00:44:16.570	00:44:19.280	build an aircraft at AirBus; it takes 216 employees to
691	00:44:19.290	00:44:22.200	build an aircraft at Boeing. That's a very telling statistic
692	00:44:22.210	00:44:24.120	that tells you something about the belt of efficiency of
693	00:44:24.130	00:44:26.800	these two operations at this point in time. Boeing's Alan
694	00:44:26.810	00:44:30.260	Mulally, who heads the commercial plane division, points out that
695	00:44:30.270	00:44:33.430	the company has, in fact, started implementing changes to beat
696	00:44:33.440	00:44:37.030	the profit problem. He says Boeing is becoming more efficient
697	00:44:37.040	00:44:40.700	in its manufacturing and remains on schedule to deliver a
698	00:44:40.710	00:44:44.050	record number of jets next year. We have a commitment
699	00:44:44.060	00:44:47.280	to deliver the 620 airplanes next year. That looks really
700	00:44:47.290	00:44:51.840	good. The airlines want them. We're getting the airplane's production
701	00:44:51.850	00:44:55.210	system back in sequence where it's getting healthy again. We're
702	00:44:55.220	00:44:59.420	delivering airplanes, we're producing the airplanes. When we said we
703	00:44:59.430	00:45:01.850	were going to make them, the quality of the airplanes
704	00:45:01.860	00:45:06.120	gets better every day with every airplane, so the whole
705	00:45:06.130	00:45:10.310	team has rallied around getting our production health back from
706	00:45:10.320	00:45:13.600	this tough situation we've been. I think that through '99
707	00:45:13.610	00:45:15.420	and going forward, I think it'll give us a good
708	00:45:15.430	00:45:18.910	base to get back to a--you know--a profitable
709	00:45:18.920	00:45:22.940	and a healthy Boeing. Meantime, economist Dick Conway thinks the
710	00:45:22.950	00:45:26.010	Seattle area will weather the blow of the Boeing layoffs
711	00:45:26.020	00:45:29.680	because its economy is more diversified than in the past.
712	00:45:29.690	00:45:34.870	Back in 1970, when Boeing also had about 100,000 workers
713	00:45:34.880	00:45:39.420	in the area, the company accounted for about one in
714	00:45:39.430	00:45:45.040	three jobs in the entire economy here. Today, it's closer
715	00:45:45.050	00:45:50.260	to one in six jobs. That's why we figure that
716	00:45:50.270	00:45:55.370	we're better able to withstand a Boeing downturn--quite apart
717	00:45:55.380	00:45:59.950	from the fact that the anticipated cutbacks at Boeing are
718	00:45:59.960	00:46:02.310	quite a bit less than they were back in 1970.
719	00:46:02.320	00:46:04.630	But airline analysts say it could take up to five
720	00:46:04.640	00:46:08.050	years for Boeing to rebound. They say for Boeing to
721	00:46:08.060	00:46:12.170	survive, it must become more efficient and in the future,
722	00:46:12.180	00:46:25.680	that will mean building jets with far fewer workers. Finally
723	00:46:25.690	00:46:29.770	tonight a conversation about Cambodia. More than a million citizens
724	00:46:29.780	00:46:32.710	of that Southeast Asian nation died during the reign of
725	00:46:32.720	00:46:36.960	the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s. Today Cambodian
726	00:46:36.970	00:46:41.050	Prime Minister Hun Sen welcomed home two former Khmer Rouge
727	00:46:41.060	00:46:44.090	leaders and said it was time to bury the past.
728	00:46:44.100	00:46:49.720	Terence Smith recently recorded this conversation about Cambodia. After nearly
729	00:46:49.730	00:46:53.190	thirty years of war and turmoil, Cambodia today is a
730	00:46:53.200	00:46:57.350	crippled nation. An American journalist who has charted that country's
731	00:46:57.360	00:47:02.000	decline has written a powerful new book, "Cambodia, Report from
732	00:47:02.010	00:47:05.390	a Stricken Land." He is Henry Kamm, a Pulitzer Prize
733	00:47:05.400	00:47:09.110	winning former foreign correspondent for the New York Times. And
734	00:47:09.120	00:47:12.010	he joins us this evening. Henry, welcome. Hello, Terry. A
735	00:47:12.020	00:47:14.780	A little full disclosure I think is necessary here. You
736	00:47:14.790	00:47:16.960	and I have worked together. A good deal. Have been
737	00:47:16.970	00:47:20.360	friends for years and worked together, including in Southeast Asia.
738	00:47:20.370	00:47:23.030	Including in Southeast Asia and the Middle Eastern war at
739	00:47:23.040	00:47:28.670	one point. Tell me. Describe for me what Cambodia was
740	00:47:28.680	00:47:31.850	like--when you first went there nearly thirty years ago.
741	00:47:31.860	00:47:34.800	When I first went there, Cambodia was an--I suppose
742	00:47:34.810	00:47:37.970	it's a cliche to say--an island of peace in
743	00:47:37.980	00:47:42.660	wartorn Indochina. It was an--and its capital was a
744	00:47:42.670	00:47:47.130	very well tended city of broad avenues, lovely parks, and
745	00:47:47.140	00:47:50.670	above all, smiling faces and nowhere a threat of a
746	00:47:50.680	00:47:53.620	grenade to being thrown to break up dinner. Right. It
747	00:47:53.630	00:47:58.760	was pleasant. It was an exquisite place. Yes. And today?
748	00:47:58.770	00:48:05.190	Today, Cambodia is a country that remains devastated by the
749	00:48:05.200	00:48:08.610	various wars that have been waged in this territory. Its
750	00:48:08.620	00:48:14.500	roads are in horrid condition. Its cities have become--and
751	00:48:14.510	00:48:18.540	there are many, as you know--cities have become overcrowded,
752	00:48:18.550	00:48:22.940	overrun by rural populations in search of something better than
753	00:48:22.950	00:48:27.040	the totally impoverished life. Instead, they find in the cities
754	00:48:27.050	00:48:30.620	an equally impoverished life--no employment--and, above all,
755	00:48:30.630	00:48:34.220	they find--wherever they are--city or countryside--they find
756	00:48:34.230	00:48:39.020	a government that shows not a smidgen of interest in
757	00:48:39.030	00:48:44.570	their wellbeing. You write, in fact, of rural people, ordinary
758	00:48:44.580	00:48:47.330	Cambodians, who have flocked to the cities, living--what you
759	00:48:47.340	00:48:50.260	describe as an essentially rural life in the streets of
760	00:48:50.270	00:48:53.030	Phnom-Penh. Yes. Right. What do you mean? Rural life would
761	00:48:53.040	00:48:56.500	mean that you do not find your place in the
762	00:48:56.510	00:49:02.600	city. Your place begins with employment. It goes through steady,
763	00:49:02.610	00:49:06.360	permanent housing of some kind; it goes with schools that
764	00:49:06.370	00:49:09.090	are ready to receive your children and it goes with
765	00:49:09.100	00:49:13.670	the minimal services that, above all, medical services, that simply
766	00:49:13.680	00:49:17.580	are not available. And you talk about them tending livestock,
767	00:49:17.590	00:49:20.800	chickens, and what not, on the streets. They bring with
768	00:49:20.810	00:49:23.350	them what they can because the city offers them almost
769	00:49:23.360	00:49:26.970	nothing. And so, yes, there are chickens; there are pigs;
770	00:49:26.980	00:49:30.650	and occasionally even a buffalo walking down the main street.
771	00:49:30.660	00:49:34.900	You know, the most recent reports from Cambodia might suggest
772	00:49:34.910	00:49:38.180	a reason for hope. The last known group of Khmer
773	00:49:38.190	00:49:44.030	Rouge guerrillas recently surrendered. And now for better or for
774	00:49:44.040	00:49:48.830	worse there is an ostensibly united government under Hun Sen
775	00:49:48.840	00:49:52.240	that seems to have the blessing of King Sihanouk. Are
776	00:49:52.250	00:49:57.900	these hopeful signs? They are signs that are significant to
777	00:49:57.910	00:50:04.150	the .1% of the Cambodians who share in power. They
778	00:50:04.160	00:50:08.110	are of no significance to the 99.9% who have power
779	00:50:08.120	00:50:14.100	exercised upon them. The surrender of the Khmer Rouge was
780	00:50:14.110	00:50:20.150	a dead body that has now--one supposes been finally
781	00:50:20.160	00:50:23.790	buried. But they have been of no importance in Cambodia,
782	00:50:23.800	00:50:31.240	thank goodness, for the last two years. The election merely
783	00:50:31.250	00:50:35.830	ratified a totally irregular state of affairs that existed before,
784	00:50:35.840	00:50:39.330	namely that Hun Sen, who was put in power by
785	00:50:39.340	00:50:44.240	the Vietnamese invasion that took place in 1979, and who
786	00:50:44.250	00:50:48.030	never throughout the various exercises of politics that have occurred
787	00:50:48.040	00:50:52.130	in Cambodia since then, particularly the large United Nations' two
788	00:50:52.140	00:50:56.470	billion dollar enterprise that was supposed to bring peace, happiness
789	00:50:56.480	00:51:00.360	to the Cambodians--he maintained power throughout this--he lost
790	00:51:00.370	00:51:06.420	the UN-sponsored elections in 1993, but bludgeoned his way into
791	00:51:06.430	00:51:11.410	power, into a share of power. He gave to Sihanouk's
792	00:51:11.420	00:51:16.360	son, Prince Ranariddh the title of First Prime Minister but
793	00:51:16.370	00:51:19.470	the title of First Prime Minister is about as meaningful
794	00:51:19.480	00:51:22.670	as the notion of democracy in Cambodia. It was Hun
795	00:51:22.680	00:51:27.180	Sen and his machine, which has run Cambodia since then.
796	00:51:27.190	00:51:29.360	In the middle of last year he got tired of
797	00:51:29.370	00:51:35.060	having even this advertising sign of democracy, Ranariddh, with him
798	00:51:35.070	00:51:37.870	in sharing power, and threw him out in the coup
799	00:51:37.880	00:51:40.290	d'Ã©tat, drove him out of the country. This was not
800	00:51:40.300	00:51:43.440	accepted by the international community. It's very difficult to accept
801	00:51:43.450	00:51:47.640	the overthrow of a regime that the entire world sponsored
802	00:51:47.650	00:51:52.050	into office. And so a compromise had to be arranged,
803	00:51:52.060	00:51:55.360	and since Prince Ranariddh likes power and money as much
804	00:51:55.370	00:51:58.770	as Hun Sen does, he accepted once more a place
805	00:51:58.780	00:52:01.510	in this new regime. But this is of no meaning
806	00:52:01.520	00:52:03.930	to the people of Cambodia. Hun Sen will continue to
807	00:52:03.940	00:52:08.290	rule with an iron fist. And King Sihanouk, formerly Prince
808	00:52:08.300	00:52:12.000	Sihanouk, the man who kept the balancing act going for
809	00:52:12.010	00:52:14.420	so many years? The man who did a splendid job
810	00:52:14.430	00:52:18.750	until he was--there were many flaws--but the essence
811	00:52:18.760	00:52:24.170	was that Sihanouk until 1970--until his overthrow--kept Cambodia
812	00:52:24.180	00:52:28.380	out of war. But since then he has grown aged,
813	00:52:28.390	00:52:35.370	he is very ill with cancer, and his power is
814	00:52:35.380	00:52:39.300	like the Pope's; he has no armies. And so he
815	00:52:39.310	00:52:43.090	has to consent to whatever is offered to him in
816	00:52:43.100	00:52:47.920	order at least to remain king and possibly try with
817	00:52:47.930	00:52:50.470	the very little power that he has to prevent the
818	00:52:50.480	00:52:52.950	worst. I think that he knows that he is doomed
819	00:52:52.960	00:52:55.880	not to succeed in that. You know, you mentioned earlier
820	00:52:55.890	00:53:00.440	the $2 billion effort--Yes.--by the United Nations in the
821	00:53:00.450	00:53:03.260	early 90s to come in to impose a ceasefire and
822	00:53:03.270	00:53:05.780	to hold elections. Right. For a while it seemed to
823	00:53:05.790	00:53:08.930	be a great success story and was pointed to that
824	00:53:08.940	00:53:11.180	way. But, in fact, that is not the case, is
825	00:53:11.190	00:53:13.690	it? It was painted as a great success because the
826	00:53:13.700	00:53:18.180	United Nations did a rather clever trick. The Paris agreement
827	00:53:18.190	00:53:21.520	under which they came into Cambodia to pacify it and
828	00:53:21.530	00:53:25.970	to hold elections was meant to pacify it, and all
829	00:53:25.980	00:53:29.510	of the parties in the Cambodian conflict signed on to
830	00:53:29.520	00:53:33.200	a surrender of their military. The Khmer Rouge were the
831	00:53:33.210	00:53:37.940	first ones to resent--to refuse to give up the
832	00:53:37.950	00:53:42.640	power; therefore, all the others followed suit, and so an
833	00:53:42.650	00:53:46.470	agreement that was supposed to bring peace and to demilitarize
834	00:53:46.480	00:53:52.220	Cambodia was never respected, and then the United Nations sort
835	00:53:52.230	00:53:55.490	of hid this away and said the purpose was to
836	00:53:55.500	00:53:59.640	hold free elections. These elections were held, but, again, their
837	00:53:59.650	00:54:05.580	result was vitiated. What does it say to you, who've
838	00:54:05.590	00:54:09.080	traveled the world widely and seen UN efforts elsewhere, what
839	00:54:09.090	00:54:12.740	does it say about the limits of this kind of
840	00:54:12.750	00:54:16.920	UN intervention? It's not entirely the United Nations' fault. It's
841	00:54:16.930	00:54:21.070	the fault of the major powers who bring about UN
842	00:54:21.080	00:54:26.560	resolutions and make UN decisions. The major powers raised no
843	00:54:26.570	00:54:33.020	objection when this United Nations-sponsored agreement was totally ignored really
844	00:54:33.030	00:54:36.460	and not really applied. You speak in your book of
845	00:54:36.470	00:54:42.640	a country beyond helping itself and have a suggestion at
846	00:54:42.650	00:54:47.860	the end about what might be the answer. It is
847	00:54:47.870	00:54:52.800	less than a suggestion, Terry. I feel that the Cambodian
848	00:54:52.810	00:54:57.510	elite, the Cambodian political elite, which is greatly diminished by
849	00:54:57.520	00:55:01.980	both the murders by the Khmer Rouge, the savageness of
850	00:55:01.990	00:55:05.380	the war that preceded, and the great flow of emigration
851	00:55:05.390	00:55:08.690	from Cambodia of some of its best people--that the
852	00:55:08.700	00:55:12.800	present elite, the present holders of power, who are really
853	00:55:12.810	00:55:17.300	interested only in the holding of power--in the profits
854	00:55:17.310	00:55:20.080	that this puts into their pockets--that these people are
855	00:55:20.090	00:55:24.940	quite incapable and totally uninterested in advancing the state of
856	00:55:24.950	00:55:28.960	the Cambodian people. And since I see no change possible
857	00:55:28.970	00:55:32.430	within this elite now, it seemed to me--and it
858	00:55:32.440	00:55:35.300	is not a suggestion because it's too fanciful to be
859	00:55:35.310	00:55:38.070	taken seriously--but it seems to me that if there
860	00:55:38.080	00:55:40.660	is to be hope for Cambodia, it would be to
861	00:55:40.670	00:55:46.520	put this brutally misruled country in the hands of some
862	00:55:46.530	00:55:54.780	benevolent, uninterested, impartial force--use this power to allow a
863	00:55:54.790	00:55:59.510	new generation of Cambodians to develop normally in a country
864	00:55:59.520	00:56:02.550	in which they're not being brutalized by their government, and
865	00:56:02.560	00:56:07.840	when this new generation which recognizes the responsibilities of an
866	00:56:07.850	00:56:11.620	elite for the fate of a nation is ready to
867	00:56:11.630	00:56:14.790	take over the country, then by all means the country
868	00:56:14.800	00:56:17.690	should be taken over by the Cambodians. A trusteeship, it
869	00:56:17.700	00:56:19.940	sounds like. A form of trusteeship, but an honest form
870	00:56:19.950	00:56:25.740	of trusteeship, totally untainted by any thought of neocolonialism. I
871	00:56:25.750	00:56:29.290	think Cambodia should live under its own leadership by its
872	00:56:29.300	00:56:31.970	own devices. I regret to say that I do not
873	00:56:31.980	00:56:36.450	think it is capable of doing so today. As you
874	00:56:36.460	00:56:39.880	suggest at the end of the book, it may be
875	00:56:39.890	00:56:46.660	unrealistic, but it is not unreasonable. It is realizable theoretically.
876	00:56:46.670	00:56:49.420	I doubt that the will exists to realize it, but
877	00:56:49.430	00:56:52.180	I will be delighted to see it realized. Henry Kamm,
878	00:56:52.190	00:57:02.290	thank you very much. Thank you. Again, the major stories
879	00:57:02.300	00:57:05.920	of this Tuesday, a formal bribery investigation began of Salt
880	00:57:05.930	00:57:09.850	Lake City's selection as the site for the 2002 Winter
881	00:57:09.860	00:57:14.830	Olympics; the House managers or prosecutors of President Clinton's impeachment
882	00:57:14.840	00:57:17.890	began preparing for a Senate trial; and heavy rains and
883	00:57:17.900	00:57:21.790	melting snow triggered floods and mudslides in Oregon and Washington
884	00:57:21.800	00:57:25.040	State. We'll see you online and again here tomorrow evening.
885	00:57:25.050	01:01:59.905	I'm Jim Lehrer. Thank you and good night.
