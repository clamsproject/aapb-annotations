1	00:01:53.740	00:01:56.660	Good evening. And Happy New Year! I'm Jim Lehrer. On
2	00:01:56.670	00:02:00.450	the NewsHour tonight two ways to remember 1996, as a
3	00:02:00.460	00:02:03.080	banner year for gene research and how it looked to
4	00:02:03.090	00:02:07.840	some editorial cartoonists, plus a Richard Rodriguez essay about somebody
5	00:02:07.850	00:02:11.130	named Madonna. It all follows our summary of the news
6	00:02:11.140	00:02:40.120	this holiday. There was violence in the West Bank town
7	00:02:40.130	00:02:44.040	of Hebron today. An off-duty Israeli soldier fired into a
8	00:02:44.050	00:02:47.870	crowd of Palestinian civilians. At least five Arabs were wounded
9	00:02:47.880	00:02:51.010	by the attacker who lives in a Jewish settlement elsewhere
10	00:02:51.020	00:02:54.440	on the West Bank. The shooting occurred as negotiators were
11	00:02:54.450	00:02:57.500	trying to conclude an agreement on the withdrawal of Israeli
12	00:02:57.510	00:03:00.580	troops from Hebron. We have a report from Robert Moore
13	00:03:00.590	00:03:08.070	of Independent Television News. Within seconds of the shooting Israeli
14	00:03:08.080	00:03:10.840	soldiers pounced on a Jewish settler, forcing him to the
15	00:03:10.850	00:03:13.950	ground after he had fired his assault rifle directly into
16	00:03:13.960	00:03:20.040	Hebron's crowded marketplace. The settler, who is also a serving
17	00:03:20.050	00:03:22.840	soldier and was in uniform, was raced from the scene
18	00:03:22.850	00:03:28.720	for his own protection. There were fears that Palestinians would
19	00:03:28.730	00:03:33.200	seek immediate revenge for this attack. It is the latest
20	00:03:33.210	00:03:35.250	bloodshed in a city that is on the verge of
21	00:03:35.260	00:03:38.780	a transfer of power. As the wounded were taken away,
22	00:03:38.790	00:03:41.760	the attacker admitted he had wanted to sabotage the Hebron
23	00:03:41.770	00:03:46.440	peace agreement. Sporadic violence broke out across the city this
24	00:03:46.450	00:03:50.990	afternoon. Palestinians, who under the imminent Hebron deal are poised
25	00:03:51.000	00:03:54.100	to gain self-rule, say there can never be peace while
26	00:03:54.110	00:03:58.720	the Jewish settlers live in their midst. Israeli security forces
27	00:03:58.730	00:04:02.620	identified the gunman as 22 year old Noam Friedman, who
28	00:04:02.630	00:04:06.020	was drafted five months ago. Friedman was wearing a military
29	00:04:06.030	00:04:08.060	uniform at the time of the shooting but had not
30	00:04:08.070	00:04:12.070	been assigned to duty in Hebron. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu
31	00:04:12.080	00:04:16.780	immediately phone Palestinian leader Arafat to condemn the shooting. President
32	00:04:16.790	00:04:20.930	Clinton also called Arafat to offer his condolences. Israeli and
33	00:04:20.940	00:04:25.700	Palestinian negotiators went ahead with today's talks on Palestinian control
34	00:04:25.710	00:04:29.850	of Hebron. On the Peruvian hostage story seven more captives
35	00:04:29.860	00:04:33.890	were released from the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima today,
36	00:04:33.900	00:04:39.240	including four Japanese citizens and three Peruvians of Japanese descent.
37	00:04:39.250	00:04:42.080	A Roman Catholic bishop, who has been a frequent visitor
38	00:04:42.090	00:04:45.080	to the hostages, announced the men would be freed. They
39	00:04:45.090	00:04:47.670	left the residence on a bus for a police medical
40	00:04:47.680	00:04:51.700	center. The terrorists holding the remaining 74 hostages have demanded
41	00:04:51.710	00:04:56.500	the release of 300 of their comrades from Peruvian jails.
42	00:04:56.510	00:04:58.760	In this country today there was more bad weather in
43	00:04:58.770	00:05:02.870	the Northwest. Heavy rains hit Northern California. The National Weather
44	00:05:02.880	00:05:06.990	Service predicted disastrous flood levels for the Russian and Napa
45	00:05:07.000	00:05:10.780	Rivers North of San Francisco. Temperatures rose to a record
46	00:05:10.790	00:05:15.620	54 degrees in Seattle, melting snow and causing mud slides.
47	00:05:15.630	00:05:18.860	Washington Governor Mike Lowry declared a state of emergency in
48	00:05:18.870	00:05:22.570	19 counties. At least 11 deaths have been blamed on
49	00:05:22.580	00:05:26.380	the weather. Property damage in Washington, Oregon, and California is
50	00:05:26.390	00:05:31.150	estimated at up to $250 million. The weather did not
51	00:05:31.160	00:05:35.500	affect the 108th Tournament of Roses Parade in Southern California.
52	00:05:35.510	00:05:38.420	An estimated 1 million people were there in Pasadena to
53	00:05:38.430	00:05:42.730	watch the parade that had the theme "life's shining moments."
54	00:05:42.740	00:05:46.760	The event began with a B-2 flyover, followed by the
55	00:05:46.770	00:05:51.510	traditional procession of flower-laden floats. Among them was a float
56	00:05:51.520	00:05:54.950	celebrating the kingdom of Thailand which won an award for
57	00:05:54.960	00:05:58.750	outstanding showmanship. And that's it for the News Summary this
58	00:05:58.760	00:06:02.170	New Year's Day. Now it's on to gene research, a
59	00:06:02.180	00:06:15.300	cartoonist's view of '96, and a Richard Rodriguez essay. We
60	00:06:15.310	00:06:18.000	begin tonight with a look at what has been a
61	00:06:18.010	00:06:22.060	banner year for gene research and on tape we go
62	00:06:22.070	00:06:26.280	to our business correspondent Paul Solman of WGBH-Boston. He prepared
63	00:06:26.290	00:06:30.940	this assessment last week. What makes us tick and what
64	00:06:30.950	00:06:34.250	makes us sick? Gene research is literally about the stuff
65	00:06:34.260	00:06:36.930	of life, and this year saw major new advances on
66	00:06:36.940	00:06:40.900	the scientific and commercial front. We begin with this background
67	00:06:40.910	00:06:48.630	from Fred De Sam Lazaro of KTCA-St. Paul-Minneapolis. Seven years
68	00:06:48.640	00:06:52.800	ago cystic fibrosis, a degenerative lung disease of children, was
69	00:06:52.810	00:06:57.140	traced to its genetic foundation. Scientists were able to identify
70	00:06:57.150	00:07:06.140	a gene that, when defective, causes cystic fibrosis. The discovery
71	00:07:06.150	00:07:09.160	by a team of scientists led by Dr. Francis Collins
72	00:07:09.170	00:07:13.780	was widely acclaimed. Isolating a single gene from the 80,000
73	00:07:13.790	00:07:16.950	or so found in every human cell was the equivalent
74	00:07:16.960	00:07:20.590	of locating a house somewhere between California and New York,
75	00:07:20.600	00:07:23.230	with no clue as to the street address or even
76	00:07:23.240	00:07:26.450	the city. Cloning the cystic fibrosis gene was really a
77	00:07:26.460	00:07:31.670	great leap forward and in cloning technology, and it was
78	00:07:31.680	00:07:36.830	a huge and laudable effort. And a lot of those
79	00:07:36.840	00:07:43.650	techniques are still certainly, you know, applicable to today. University
80	00:07:43.660	00:07:47.490	of Minnesota geneticist Dr. Scott McIvor says since the cystic
81	00:07:47.500	00:07:51.660	fibrosis breakthrough shortcuts have been honed and developed to sift
82	00:07:51.670	00:07:56.740	through the complex maze of DNA. Individual genes, the basic
83	00:07:56.750	00:08:00.250	building blocks that determine every aspect of life, are not
84	00:08:00.260	00:08:04.520	only numerous, each consists of tens of thousands of precisely
85	00:08:04.530	00:08:09.520	sequenced bits of protein called bases or nucleotides. The DNA
86	00:08:09.530	00:08:11.690	samples are loaded here where you see these teeth sticking
87	00:08:11.700	00:08:16.250	in. Today, new techniques have allowed scientists like Dr. Alexander
88	00:08:16.260	00:08:20.850	Kamb to screen DNA samples in search of genes. Thereâ€™s
89	00:08:20.860	00:08:25.610	a laser here which excites the fluorescent dyes, and that's
90	00:08:25.620	00:08:30.320	internalized in the computer, displayed here as an image in
91	00:08:30.330	00:08:33.180	color, and so you can see now the result of
92	00:08:33.190	00:08:36.680	that, all these little ladders here, little bands corresponding to
93	00:08:36.690	00:08:39.160	different bases in the nucleotide sequence. And if a person
94	00:08:39.170	00:08:42.150	has, for example, a mutation at a particular position and
95	00:08:42.160	00:08:45.230	a particular gene, this kind of analysis will tell you
96	00:08:45.240	00:08:48.840	that. Meanwhile, under the auspices of the federal government's Human
97	00:08:48.850	00:08:52.850	Genome Project now headed by Dr. Francis Collins, the entire
98	00:08:52.860	00:08:56.760	genome is being mapped. Scientists across the world add to
99	00:08:56.770	00:08:59.760	this database when they locate a gene. Those who want
100	00:08:59.770	00:09:02.690	to study the genetic basis of the disease now have
101	00:09:02.700	00:09:06.140	access in journals or on the Internet to a growing
102	00:09:06.150	00:09:09.690	road map that can lead them to candidate genes, providing
103	00:09:09.700	00:09:13.310	either a general location, like which of the 23 chromosomes
104	00:09:13.320	00:09:16.770	the gene is on, or a more precise address. The
105	00:09:16.780	00:09:20.840	analogy in this case would be that the chromosomal assignment
106	00:09:20.850	00:09:24.670	would tell you which state it's in, and the much
107	00:09:24.680	00:09:29.490	more fine structure map that's provided by the Human Genome
108	00:09:29.500	00:09:33.000	Project, and eventually the sequence would give you an actual
109	00:09:33.010	00:09:37.670	street map, or an even house-to-house map. Pursuing that analogy
110	00:09:37.680	00:09:41.020	further, once McIvor has located a house, he can then
111	00:09:41.030	00:09:44.070	start to look for burned out light bulbs, defects or
112	00:09:44.080	00:09:48.840	mutations in genes, like missing or wrongly sequenced bases, the
113	00:09:48.850	00:09:52.620	kind of things that lead to disease. Doh is working
114	00:09:52.630	00:10:01.300	with a retroviral vector that she's been engineering for treatment
115	00:10:01.310	00:10:06.380	of a disease called Hurler Syndrome and the idea is
116	00:10:06.390	00:10:13.400	to use this retroviral vector to introduce a functional gene
117	00:10:13.410	00:10:17.050	and hopefully, if we can use this retrovirus to introduce
118	00:10:17.060	00:10:21.620	a functional iduronidase gene, then we may be able to
119	00:10:21.630	00:10:26.430	correct the disease conditions in Hurler Syndrome. A little transplant
120	00:10:26.440	00:10:30.630	that's happening. Right. A gene transplant. McIvor's is one of
121	00:10:30.640	00:10:34.000	several labs that have taken the next step to gene
122	00:10:34.010	00:10:38.000	therapy, trying to find a way to reintroduce functioning genes
123	00:10:38.010	00:10:41.200	to take the place of faulty ones. We don't really
124	00:10:41.210	00:10:45.370	have the capability yet to go back and turn on
125	00:10:45.380	00:10:51.150	specific light bulbs again, but we may be able to
126	00:10:51.160	00:10:54.470	plug in an extra light bulb somewhere else that would
127	00:10:54.480	00:10:58.130	illuminate the area that needs to be illuminated. And restore
128	00:10:58.140	00:11:02.390	function essentially. Right. Although gene therapy has shown promise in
129	00:11:02.400	00:11:06.860	limited trials, most scientists agree it's in early infancy, years
130	00:11:06.870	00:11:10.450	away from clinical application. For now, the big news has
131	00:11:10.460	00:11:14.040	been in the discovery of genes. So far nearly 1/4
132	00:11:14.050	00:11:17.780	of the genome, 20,000 genes, have been located, most of
133	00:11:17.790	00:11:22.280	them just identified, others linked to traits or conditions ranging
134	00:11:22.290	00:11:27.110	from obesity to anxiety. More importantly, mapping has been used
135	00:11:27.120	00:11:30.930	to locate 78 crucial proteins that are directly linked to
136	00:11:30.940	00:11:37.340	diseases. In 1996 alone, 21 such disease genes were identified
137	00:11:37.350	00:11:41.560	responsible for certain forms of Alzheimer's, diabetes, and skin cancer,
138	00:11:41.570	00:11:46.670	among others. Last month scientists located markers, the approximate location
139	00:11:46.680	00:11:50.460	of a gene linked to Parkinson's Disease, and in another
140	00:11:50.470	00:11:55.190	significant find one responsible for certain forms of prostate cancer,
141	00:11:55.200	00:11:57.840	one of the most common causes of death in American
142	00:11:57.850	00:12:00.260	men. She had breast cancer first at 29 and then
143	00:12:00.270	00:12:04.750	again at 39. Also in 1996 building on the discovery
144	00:12:04.760	00:12:08.590	earlier of genes linked to some breast cancers tests became
145	00:12:08.600	00:12:12.500	commercially available to screen women for the genes and, therefore,
146	00:12:12.510	00:12:16.960	their predisposition to these breast cancers. Now to our discussion.
147	00:12:16.970	00:12:19.890	Dr. Francis Collins, as we've just seen, directs the Human
148	00:12:19.900	00:12:23.490	Genome Project, officially known as the National Center for Human
149	00:12:23.500	00:12:27.110	Genome Research. Mary Jo Ellis Kahn is a patient advocate
150	00:12:27.120	00:12:30.590	with the National Breast Cancer Coalition. Steven Holtzman is chief
151	00:12:30.600	00:12:35.240	business officer of Millennium Pharmaceuticals, a biotech firm in Boston,
152	00:12:35.250	00:12:37.830	and Patricia King is a professor on law and medical
153	00:12:37.840	00:12:41.700	ethics at Georgetown University Law School here in Washington. And,
154	00:12:41.710	00:12:45.300	welcome to you all. Dr. Collins, let's start with you.
155	00:12:45.310	00:12:48.950	How significant a year was it in terms of genetics
156	00:12:48.960	00:12:51.850	and why? I think it's been a remarkable year. At
157	00:12:51.860	00:12:55.090	the basic science level, the Human Genome Project which started
158	00:12:55.100	00:13:00.010	in 1990, past its sixth birthday, able to claim victory
159	00:13:00.020	00:13:03.440	with the genetic maps that were the first milestone for
160	00:13:03.450	00:13:06.990	the project well ahead of schedule. The physical maps that
161	00:13:07.000	00:13:10.470	we needed are also probably about 96 percent done. We
162	00:13:10.480	00:13:14.090	finished--Physical maps means the city level, the state level.
163	00:13:14.100	00:13:15.930	The physical maps you can think of as sort of
164	00:13:15.940	00:13:19.090	chunks of DNA, the road maps of the cities and
165	00:13:19.100	00:13:22.350	counties that you need to achieve that house-to-house search that
166	00:13:22.360	00:13:24.450	you eventually need to get to if you're going to
167	00:13:24.460	00:13:27.710	have all the games in front of you. The sequence,
168	00:13:27.720	00:13:29.990	i.e, the series of the letters, the A, C, G,
169	00:13:30.000	00:13:34.360	and T, i.e., that four-letter alphabet of DNA, of all
170	00:13:34.370	00:13:36.550	of the human DNA is now the part that we
171	00:13:36.560	00:13:39.370	are rolling up our sleeves and wading into. And there
172	00:13:39.380	00:13:44.200	are 3 billion letters in that particular instruction book. Thatâ€™s
173	00:13:44.210	00:13:46.040	what Fred was looking at with the guy in the
174	00:13:46.050	00:13:49.630	computer, looking at--Right. Coming out of that colored ladder
175	00:13:49.640	00:13:52.280	on the screen. If you printed out the entire human
176	00:13:52.290	00:13:56.350	instruction book in books with average font size and page
177	00:13:56.360	00:13:59.570	size and piled them one on top of the other,
178	00:13:59.580	00:14:02.330	it would be about the height of the Washington Monument.
179	00:14:02.340	00:14:04.490	And so far we've only done about 1 percent of
180	00:14:04.500	00:14:06.530	that. But seven or eight years from now we'll have
181	00:14:06.540	00:14:08.960	done it all. Mr. Holtzman, in terms of what we've
182	00:14:08.970	00:14:12.780	done in terms of commercial breakthroughs, we've seen genes for
183	00:14:12.790	00:14:17.430	I think there's novelty-seeking even, somebody said, anxiety, things like
184	00:14:17.440	00:14:20.450	that. How big a breakthrough in a commercial sense has
185	00:14:20.460	00:14:23.700	this year been? Well, as little as two to three
186	00:14:23.710	00:14:26.880	years ago, there was a common belief that genetics would
187	00:14:26.890	00:14:30.630	be important only for relatively rare disorders which are called
188	00:14:30.640	00:14:34.510	single gene disorders, such as cystic fibrosis. What's happened in
189	00:14:34.520	00:14:36.720	the last year to year and a half is a
190	00:14:36.730	00:14:40.840	recognition that genetics is essentially a tool, genetics and genomics,
191	00:14:40.850	00:14:46.150	as it's called, for elucidating the underlying biological causes of
192	00:14:46.160	00:14:50.080	disease, including the most major forms of common diseases, our
193	00:14:50.090	00:14:53.750	susceptibility to them, and elucidating the causes of the progression
194	00:14:53.760	00:14:58.450	and initiation of those diseases. That kind of understanding provides
195	00:14:58.460	00:15:02.060	the basis for starting to develop drugs which can address
196	00:15:02.070	00:15:05.050	those diseases at their underlying cause, and not just gene
197	00:15:05.060	00:15:08.360	therapies but early available drugs of the type that major
198	00:15:08.370	00:15:11.120	pharmaceutical companies are interested in. Are we close to getting
199	00:15:11.130	00:15:13.110	those kinds of drugs? Have we begun to get them?
200	00:15:13.120	00:15:15.110	No, we haven't even begun to get them. What we've
201	00:15:15.120	00:15:17.800	begun to get is the kind of understanding that allows
202	00:15:17.810	00:15:21.570	us to begin to think about developing medicines which can
203	00:15:21.580	00:15:24.780	actually prevent and cure disease for the first time, as
204	00:15:24.790	00:15:27.890	opposed to only palliating symptoms. And as a result, the
205	00:15:27.900	00:15:32.420	pharmaceutical companies have made significant investments in young biotechnology companies,
206	00:15:32.430	00:15:36.090	such as Millennium, who've made early investments in this technology.
207	00:15:36.100	00:15:38.370	Okay. Ms. Kahn, how big a year from the consumer
208	00:15:38.380	00:15:41.770	or patient point of view? Well, it's been a wonderful
209	00:15:41.780	00:15:44.450	year for great potential. There's a potential that we will
210	00:15:44.460	00:15:46.900	find out the secrets of breast cancer enough that we
211	00:15:46.910	00:15:49.790	can prevent or cure it, but we're not there yet.
212	00:15:49.800	00:15:53.530	And from the viewpoint that we are in--breast cancer
213	00:15:53.540	00:15:56.670	patients are in grave danger at the moment because we
214	00:15:56.680	00:15:59.040	have not put in place the policies that we need
215	00:15:59.050	00:16:01.580	to protect us from discrimination. "We," so you mean you
216	00:16:01.590	00:16:03.940	are a breast cancer patient? I am a breast cancer
217	00:16:03.950	00:16:07.070	patient with a family history, and I have two young
218	00:16:07.080	00:16:11.210	daughters, and although finding out our genetic status may be
219	00:16:11.220	00:16:14.850	very useful to the family to learn who needs to
220	00:16:14.860	00:16:18.650	be followed more carefully and what medical care we should
221	00:16:18.660	00:16:22.000	receive, it's too dangerous at this point because my daughters
222	00:16:22.010	00:16:25.490	could lose their health insurance based on just testing. And
223	00:16:25.500	00:16:29.680	that's the kind of issue that these breakthroughs raise, right,
224	00:16:29.690	00:16:32.690	Professor King? That's correct. This has been a banner year
225	00:16:32.700	00:16:36.660	but it's not unusual at all. The resolution of some
226	00:16:36.670	00:16:42.680	of the legal and ethical problems really lag far behind
227	00:16:42.690	00:16:46.360	the scientific breakthroughs. So we're still trying to work out
228	00:16:46.370	00:16:51.090	the policies not only for clinical screening but for an
229	00:16:51.100	00:16:55.200	introduction of new tests for general use. But we have
230	00:16:55.210	00:17:01.040	bigger problems like health insurance, keeping information private and confidential.
231	00:17:01.050	00:17:04.580	We have problems with discrimination. We have potential problems with
232	00:17:04.590	00:17:09.740	discrimination in the work place based on one's genetic traits.
233	00:17:09.750	00:17:12.120	So we have a lot to do, I think, but
234	00:17:12.130	00:17:17.360	I'm hopeful because major breakthroughs have a way of crystallizing
235	00:17:17.370	00:17:20.850	the public mind to tackle these kinds of issues, and
236	00:17:20.860	00:17:22.890	that may be what we needed. Let's go back to
237	00:17:22.900	00:17:24.520	the issues in a minute, if we could. There are
238	00:17:24.530	00:17:27.310	a couple of questions I just have personally. For example,
239	00:17:27.320	00:17:29.710	Dr. Collins, how close are we, do you suppose, in
240	00:17:29.720	00:17:33.890	years to a major breakthrough on the aging process? I
241	00:17:33.900	00:17:36.950	say this out of some personal concern here. I mean,
242	00:17:36.960	00:17:39.540	are we at the point where we could begin to
243	00:17:39.550	00:17:43.810	think about reversing or making headway on the aging process?
244	00:17:43.820	00:17:46.480	It's always hard to answer these questions about how far
245	00:17:46.490	00:17:49.930	are we away. We have certainly made strives in understanding
246	00:17:49.940	00:17:53.290	aging, actually from a genetic point of view. A relatively
247	00:17:53.300	00:17:56.480	rare condition called Werner's Syndrome, which is one of these
248	00:17:56.490	00:18:01.000	premature aging disorders, had its gene found this year. And
249	00:18:01.010	00:18:04.020	that is probably a window into a process that's been
250	00:18:04.030	00:18:07.300	pretty obscure until now. Certainly when it comes to some
251	00:18:07.310	00:18:10.450	of the diseases of aging, such as Alzheimer's and prostate
252	00:18:10.460	00:18:13.640	cancer, there have been breakthroughs this year. But in terms
253	00:18:13.650	00:18:17.480	of understanding the process by which everything sort of wears
254	00:18:17.490	00:18:20.130	out and runs down, that is going to be a
255	00:18:20.140	00:18:23.140	very difficult process. And I don't think we're anywhere near
256	00:18:23.150	00:18:25.660	to that fountain of youth model that some people hope
257	00:18:25.670	00:18:27.300	for. Yeah. That's what I was hoping for. I'm sorry.
258	00:18:27.310	00:18:30.470	Mr. Holtzman, average longevity for a kid born in the
259	00:18:30.480	00:18:33.060	year 2000, for example. I mean, I don't--we'll never
260	00:18:33.070	00:18:36.070	get back to you on this, but do you think
261	00:18:36.080	00:18:40.200	we're going to have substantially increased longevity say for kids
262	00:18:40.210	00:18:43.000	being born in the next few years? Not in the
263	00:18:43.010	00:18:46.540	next few years. I think, as Dr. Collins indicated, if
264	00:18:46.550	00:18:48.820	we look at what gets in the way of longevity,
265	00:18:48.830	00:18:51.460	namely certain diseases of aging, we will have insight into
266	00:18:51.470	00:18:54.790	those and better drugs for treating those. What about cancer?
267	00:18:54.800	00:18:58.950	We're talking here about breast cancer specifically. I think the
268	00:18:58.960	00:19:00.930	cancer rate has for the first year gone down in
269	00:19:00.940	00:19:03.960	terms of survival. That's a five-year survival rate still, or
270	00:19:03.970	00:19:08.300	no? No. That's mortality statistics across the population for a
271	00:19:08.310	00:19:11.720	number of cancers for the first time this century have
272	00:19:11.730	00:19:15.160	begun to decline, not entirely clear all the reasons for
273	00:19:15.170	00:19:18.620	that, but obviously not declining nearly fast enough to suit
274	00:19:18.630	00:19:21.490	most of us. Cancer is an area where I think
275	00:19:21.500	00:19:24.400	the potential for advances in the next ten to fifteen
276	00:19:24.410	00:19:28.170	years are really quite substantial because cancer comes about because
277	00:19:28.180	00:19:31.230	of mutations in DNA. We are learning a lot about
278	00:19:31.240	00:19:34.200	mutations in DNA, and we should be able to harness
279	00:19:34.210	00:19:37.580	that into the development of more effective therapy in the
280	00:19:37.590	00:19:40.530	not-too-distant future, but we're not quite there yet for most
281	00:19:40.540	00:19:44.220	of the common cancers. So that's why you're happy. What
282	00:19:44.230	00:19:47.230	exactly are you worried about? I mean, explain to us
283	00:19:47.240	00:19:50.290	what you mean when you're worried about knowing things for
284	00:19:50.300	00:19:54.120	you and for your children. Well, until we have in
285	00:19:54.130	00:19:58.580	place a treatment that goes with genetic testing where we
286	00:19:58.590	00:20:01.300	can say that there is obvious benefit, and everyone agree
287	00:20:01.310	00:20:03.590	you should be tested, you should get this treatment, then
288	00:20:03.600	00:20:06.560	what we're left with is a lot of information, powerful
289	00:20:06.570	00:20:10.930	information, that may or may not improve our quality of
290	00:20:10.940	00:20:13.920	life. Currently there is a cancer, a breast cancer test
291	00:20:13.930	00:20:17.450	available of some sort? Well, there are two genes that
292	00:20:17.460	00:20:20.140	are--if you have a mutation in them--are associated
293	00:20:20.150	00:20:23.060	with an increased risk of breast cancer. But it's not
294	00:20:23.070	00:20:27.260	clear in everyone who carries a mutation what your risk
295	00:20:27.270	00:20:31.710	is. It's not clear at what year you'll get breast
296	00:20:31.720	00:20:34.250	cancer if you do get it. There's a lot of
297	00:20:34.260	00:20:37.170	things unknown still, but there is a test, and in
298	00:20:37.180	00:20:39.380	some high risk families where there are lots of members
299	00:20:39.390	00:20:42.510	affected by breast and ovarian cancer it might be useful
300	00:20:42.520	00:20:45.930	to know if you carry one of these mutations. But
301	00:20:45.940	00:20:48.740	since you can't prevent it, and you can't cure breast
302	00:20:48.750	00:20:52.360	cancer in every incidence, then what you really need to
303	00:20:52.370	00:20:56.580	do is provide a way to do the research. And
304	00:20:56.590	00:21:00.590	if we have discrimination as a major risk, women will
305	00:21:00.600	00:21:02.760	not be able to participate in these studies. We can't
306	00:21:02.770	00:21:06.650	get to a decreased mortality. What do you mean by
307	00:21:06.660	00:21:10.390	discrimination? I'm not following? Well, our biggest risk right now
308	00:21:10.400	00:21:14.790	is health insurance discrimination. And if the health insurance industry
309	00:21:14.800	00:21:17.540	were able to say for those people who can be
310	00:21:17.550	00:21:21.700	tested for breast cancer, colon cancer, Alzheimer's, any number of
311	00:21:21.710	00:21:25.950	diseases that we'll soon have tests for, that from birth
312	00:21:25.960	00:21:29.680	you are no longer eligible to buy insurance, then you
313	00:21:29.690	00:21:34.950	will have a genetically disadvantaged population who eventually could die
314	00:21:34.960	00:21:37.260	of these diseases simply because they can't get care. So
315	00:21:37.270	00:21:39.640	you wouldn't take the test, you haven't had your kids
316	00:21:39.650	00:21:41.770	take the test? My family's decided that it's not in
317	00:21:41.780	00:21:45.000	our best interest because my daughters and my niece, the
318	00:21:45.010	00:21:48.260	next generation, need their health insurance more than they need
319	00:21:48.270	00:21:51.730	this information. So it's not out of fear of finding
320	00:21:51.740	00:21:54.310	out the results; it's out of the health insurance, the
321	00:21:54.320	00:21:57.970	worry about health insurance? Yes, absolutely. And Patricia King, how
322	00:21:57.980	00:21:59.970	do we deal with that? I mean, is that the
323	00:21:59.980	00:22:04.150	major issue that's raised by genetic testing or screening? Well,
324	00:22:04.160	00:22:06.600	it's one of the major issues. It's not the only
325	00:22:06.610	00:22:10.410	one. But not only does it present problems for individuals
326	00:22:10.420	00:22:12.780	because the information is powerful, not only do you have
327	00:22:12.790	00:22:15.130	a problem in getting health insurance, you may have a
328	00:22:15.140	00:22:19.400	problem getting employment because remember, most health insurance in this
329	00:22:19.410	00:22:23.990	country is provided for by employers. Health insurance is expensive.
330	00:22:24.000	00:22:26.760	So you not only have to worry about your coverage;
331	00:22:26.770	00:22:29.160	you have to worry about your employment; and you have
332	00:22:29.170	00:22:31.950	to worry about what to tell your children or, indeed,
333	00:22:31.960	00:22:34.890	whether to have children. So the information is quite powerful.
334	00:22:34.900	00:22:39.860	And this information feeds on existing inequities in our system.
335	00:22:39.870	00:22:43.910	We can't currently protect persons who know they are at
336	00:22:43.920	00:22:47.930	risk for certain diseases or, in fact, have certain diseases
337	00:22:47.940	00:22:51.260	with respect to health insurance or even employment. We're just
338	00:22:51.270	00:22:56.140	beginning to come to grips with this problem. We can't
339	00:22:56.150	00:23:00.840	yet assure you that the information, should we get it,
340	00:23:00.850	00:23:05.090	would be protected and kept confidential. So it's not only
341	00:23:05.100	00:23:09.230	an individual problem; it's a huge social problem that feeds
342	00:23:09.240	00:23:12.760	into a system that already has problems, not to mention
343	00:23:12.770	00:23:16.180	that if we actually can do something for people who
344	00:23:16.190	00:23:20.240	are screened one day for breast cancer, we can't assure
345	00:23:20.250	00:23:22.430	some people that they will have access to the health
346	00:23:22.440	00:23:24.910	care system at all, not with just with respect to
347	00:23:24.920	00:23:27.540	insurance, but because they may not be able to afford
348	00:23:27.550	00:23:30.360	it. So this is the tip of the iceberg in
349	00:23:30.370	00:23:32.850	terms of our social problems. Dr. Collins, how do researchers
350	00:23:32.860	00:23:35.760	deal with these issues? I think many researchers are deeply
351	00:23:35.770	00:23:38.160	concerned about this as well. I certainly am. I think
352	00:23:38.170	00:23:41.870	it will be a terrible tragedy if this set of
353	00:23:41.880	00:23:46.740	scientific advances with so much promise to benefit humankind gets,
354	00:23:46.750	00:23:50.450	instead, converted into a new way to discriminate against people
355	00:23:50.460	00:23:53.800	in an ever more powerful and unfair fashion, and the
356	00:23:53.810	00:23:57.120	whole field ends up, therefore, stillborn as the advance in
357	00:23:57.130	00:23:59.510	medicine that we would have wanted it to be, that
358	00:23:59.520	00:24:02.530	would be the greatest tragedy. I think there is some
359	00:24:02.540	00:24:06.660	movement, though, in addressing these issues. Only a few months
360	00:24:06.670	00:24:11.160	ago, the Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Bill was passed and signed
361	00:24:11.170	00:24:13.890	by the President. It does say that at least in
362	00:24:13.900	00:24:18.160	some circumstances health insurance companies may not use genetic information
363	00:24:18.170	00:24:21.630	to deny coverage. It has areas that it doesn't cover
364	00:24:21.640	00:24:25.040	which seriously need to be addressed quickly, but in this
365	00:24:25.050	00:24:27.580	past year, there were no less than a dozen bills
366	00:24:27.590	00:24:30.870	in Congress that dealt with genetic discrimination and privacy. And
367	00:24:30.880	00:24:33.470	I suspect in the 105th Congress there will be at
368	00:24:33.480	00:24:37.220	least that much interest. But it's--the time is now.
369	00:24:37.230	00:24:39.930	We have to wait this time for a crisis, for
370	00:24:39.940	00:24:43.660	a catastrophe for everybody running around, wringing their hands, saying,
371	00:24:43.670	00:24:45.560	how did we get to this point, that will be
372	00:24:45.570	00:24:48.220	so unnecessary and so tragic. I want to ask Mr.
373	00:24:48.230	00:24:50.110	Holtzman, how do you respond to this from a business
374	00:24:50.120	00:24:52.200	point of view? For example, there's this breast cancer test
375	00:24:52.210	00:24:54.670	that's being sold in Utah. Do you think that a
376	00:24:54.680	00:24:57.540	company should be marketing a breast cancer test, given the
377	00:24:57.550	00:25:00.300	little amount we know, and the potential for discrimination that
378	00:25:00.310	00:25:03.350	currently exists until such legislation would come in? Well, I
379	00:25:03.360	00:25:05.530	think the first point to make is the industry has
380	00:25:05.540	00:25:09.660	taken a stand completely consistent with the scientific community stand,
381	00:25:09.670	00:25:14.430	as represented by Dr. Collins. The Biotechnology Industry Organization was
382	00:25:14.440	00:25:18.610	highly supportive of taking position papers in support of the
383	00:25:18.620	00:25:23.510	Kennedy-Kassebaum legislation as an active Bioethics Committee supporting these sorts
384	00:25:23.520	00:25:29.390	of anti-discriminatory--discriminatory and anti-privacy kinds of issues. But not
385	00:25:29.400	00:25:32.170	everybody in the industry, for example, I assume. Well, I
386	00:25:32.180	00:25:37.260	think it's--the organization which represents the biotech industry. Personally,
387	00:25:37.270	00:25:39.890	I have the great fortune of serving on the National
388	00:25:39.900	00:25:42.920	Bioethics Advisory Commission, and this is a major issue on
389	00:25:42.930	00:25:46.330	our plate, as well, and we are addressing. Clearly, we
390	00:25:46.340	00:25:49.140	have a stake as an industry and as people who
391	00:25:49.150	00:25:51.500	have gotten into this industry because we believe in the
392	00:25:51.510	00:25:56.660	power of the technology to ensure better technological sophistication is
393	00:25:56.670	00:26:00.090	not disserved by our social--lack of social maturity and
394	00:26:00.100	00:26:03.510	the misuse of it. Please. I wanted to ask one
395	00:26:03.520	00:26:05.460	last question. I didn't mean to cut you off, but
396	00:26:05.470	00:26:07.940	parental screening is an issue that I'd read about and
397	00:26:07.950	00:26:11.860	heard about, the idea that you could prevent a kid
398	00:26:11.870	00:26:14.380	who--as I say--who had some propensity to be,
399	00:26:14.390	00:26:17.510	I don't know, anxious, too anxious, and you didn't want
400	00:26:17.520	00:26:19.940	that kind of kid, or homosexual, or some of the
401	00:26:19.950	00:26:22.370	things that we felt about with respect to possible involvement
402	00:26:22.380	00:26:25.720	of genes. That's an issue we haven't talked about here.
403	00:26:25.730	00:26:27.600	Patricia King. Well, first of all, let me say, we
404	00:26:27.610	00:26:32.060	already have some capacity to screen fetuses prenatally for pretty
405	00:26:32.070	00:26:36.840	severe diseases. Down's Syndrome. Down's Syndrome, sickle cell anemia, for
406	00:26:36.850	00:26:40.510	example, so this won't be new; it will be magnified.
407	00:26:40.520	00:26:43.670	And one of the--Magnified hugely, wouldn't it, if you
408	00:26:43.680	00:26:44.880	could tell all kinds--That's exactly right. You have a
409	00:26:44.890	00:26:48.650	lot more screening tests for fetuses. You have magnified your
410	00:26:48.660	00:26:51.860	issues, and you've magnified them in the following way. We
411	00:26:51.870	00:26:54.570	think of Down's Syndrome as being a very serious disease,
412	00:26:54.580	00:26:57.420	sickle cell as being serious. Some of the characteristics that
413	00:26:57.430	00:27:00.180	we could potentially screen for in the future some of
414	00:27:00.190	00:27:04.630	us might not think of as being so serious that
415	00:27:04.640	00:27:07.650	we should think about not having that fetus. So one
416	00:27:07.660	00:27:09.700	of the things that I think about with respect to
417	00:27:09.710	00:27:12.850	genetics is not will it--not only will it change
418	00:27:12.860	00:27:15.330	our immediate lives in a way that we have to
419	00:27:15.340	00:27:18.150	think about but it has the potential for changing where
420	00:27:18.160	00:27:21.720	we see ourselves, our parent-child relationships, what we want from
421	00:27:21.730	00:27:24.840	our children, what we tell our children. Now, I agree
422	00:27:24.850	00:27:27.740	with Dr. Collins. I don't think I should go around
423	00:27:27.750	00:27:30.810	crying tears about what is to come. I think the
424	00:27:30.820	00:27:34.230	real challenge is to try to figure out ways to
425	00:27:34.240	00:27:38.410	take on effectively some of these issues, and I think
426	00:27:38.420	00:27:41.180	that we have sort of laid a groundwork in the
427	00:27:41.190	00:27:45.190	last six, seven years, but we really need to have
428	00:27:45.200	00:27:49.060	more concentrated, I think, national attention to deal with some
429	00:27:49.070	00:27:51.520	of the big social issues. We're dealing with in a
430	00:27:51.530	00:27:56.560	piecemeal fashion--health care in the Congress, states are passing
431	00:27:56.570	00:27:59.690	their own laws to deal with discrimination. They are doing
432	00:27:59.700	00:28:04.640	it piecemeal. We need a more concerted look at the
433	00:28:04.650	00:28:07.910	immediate issues and how they affect individuals, but some of
434	00:28:07.920	00:28:11.610	the broader social issues. In the past the President's Commission
435	00:28:11.620	00:28:16.200	on Ethics in the early 80's did wonderful work with
436	00:28:16.210	00:28:19.710	respect to big issues then and helping to educate the
437	00:28:19.720	00:28:23.590	public and prepare us for the technology. We need something
438	00:28:23.600	00:28:28.190	like that again. We need a broader group to take
439	00:28:28.200	00:28:30.140	a look at some of these issues. And I take
440	00:28:30.150	00:28:32.790	it--because you're nodding, Ms. Kahn--that you fully agree
441	00:28:32.800	00:28:36.030	with this? Oh, absolutely. I think it's very hard for
442	00:28:36.040	00:28:39.110	policy to keep up with the rapid pace of science.
443	00:28:39.120	00:28:42.470	And we need a better method of doing that. But
444	00:28:42.480	00:28:46.170	in part, it's educating the public about how to think
445	00:28:46.180	00:28:48.770	about this, rather than thinking in terms of designer children
446	00:28:48.780	00:28:51.720	and how you make a perfect child with genetics, we
447	00:28:51.730	00:28:54.680	really need to be thinking--in my family it's not
448	00:28:54.690	00:28:57.250	that the person's not valuable; it's that the disease is
449	00:28:57.260	00:28:59.750	very bad. We need to treat the disease. And if
450	00:28:59.760	00:29:02.590	we try to generalize too much--and I think that's
451	00:29:02.600	00:29:05.280	where the discrimination comes from--that just because you have
452	00:29:05.290	00:29:09.140	one mutation in all of these billions of genes that
453	00:29:09.150	00:29:12.220	that does not change the person. And so we really
454	00:29:12.230	00:29:14.940	need to keep focused on what kind of treatments we're
455	00:29:14.950	00:29:17.460	looking for. And that's that genetic determinism that you're dead
456	00:29:17.470	00:29:19.170	set against, isn't it, Dr. Collins? Which I'm very concerned
457	00:29:19.180	00:29:20.880	about. We hear about the gene for this and the
458	00:29:20.890	00:29:23.110	gene for that. And if you're talking about something like
459	00:29:23.120	00:29:26.600	anxiety or novelty seeking, good grief, this is ridiculous. Those
460	00:29:26.610	00:29:30.740	are personality characteristics which have genetic contributions that are enormously
461	00:29:30.750	00:29:33.580	complex. No single gene would account for more than a
462	00:29:33.590	00:29:36.640	tiny fraction of such characteristics, and much of that is
463	00:29:36.650	00:29:39.100	learned behavior that comes about as we're growing up as
464	00:29:39.110	00:29:42.350	kids and interacting with our environment. And I'm deeply concerned
465	00:29:42.360	00:29:46.460	that in our enthusiasm--and I'm certainly enthusiastic--to promote
466	00:29:46.470	00:29:49.750	what genetics can do for us in the medical sense
467	00:29:49.760	00:29:53.820	that we are also geneticizing other aspects of human behavior
468	00:29:53.830	00:29:56.220	to the point where people begin to conclude that every
469	00:29:56.230	00:29:59.290	aspect of what they did today was controlled by these
470	00:29:59.300	00:30:03.000	invisible marionette strings made of the double helical DNA. That
471	00:30:03.010	00:30:06.220	ain't so. We're not going to eliminate free will. We're
472	00:30:06.230	00:30:08.800	not going to eliminate the environment, even when we understand
473	00:30:08.810	00:30:11.560	the whole genome. Excellent. Well, then with free will I
474	00:30:11.570	00:30:13.510	say it's the end of the discussion. Thank you all
475	00:30:13.520	00:30:17.930	very much. Still to come on the NewsHour tonight cartoonists
476	00:30:17.940	00:30:31.240	on 1996 and a Richard Rodriguez essay. Now to a
477	00:30:31.250	00:30:33.920	second and very different view of the year that just
478	00:30:33.930	00:30:38.390	ended. It was recorded earlier by Elizabeth Farnsworth. We look
479	00:30:38.400	00:30:41.870	back at 1996 through the eyes and drawings of four
480	00:30:41.880	00:30:46.200	editorial cartoonists: Michael Ramirez, of the Memphis Commercial Appeal and
481	00:30:46.210	00:30:50.840	USA Today; Steve Kelley of the San Diego Union Tribune;
482	00:30:50.850	00:30:54.100	Doug Marlette of Newsday; and Ann Telnaes of the North
483	00:30:54.110	00:30:58.120	American Syndicate. Thank you all for being with us. Steve
484	00:30:58.130	00:31:01.310	Kelley, was this a good year for cartoonists? Oh, by
485	00:31:01.320	00:31:04.380	all means it was. We had a lot of unusual
486	00:31:04.390	00:31:07.920	events that sort of percolated to the surface. Plus, it
487	00:31:07.930	00:31:11.770	was a--it was an election year. So election years
488	00:31:11.780	00:31:15.140	are always like an all-you-can-eat buffet for a political cartoonist.
489	00:31:15.150	00:31:18.010	So we had all of those issues and, in addition,
490	00:31:18.020	00:31:21.060	a lot of sort of unusual one-day wonders I call
491	00:31:21.070	00:31:24.120	them. Like? Well, for example, the kid reached over the
492	00:31:24.130	00:31:26.690	wall in one of the playoff series and snatched the
493	00:31:26.700	00:31:31.860	ball, and Roberto Alomar spit on an umpire, and Jonathan
494	00:31:31.870	00:31:34.480	Prevett kissed a little girl on the cheek at school
495	00:31:34.490	00:31:36.730	and was sued for sexual harassment. He was in the
496	00:31:36.740	00:31:40.850	first grade. So those were all very ripe subjects for
497	00:31:40.860	00:31:43.170	political cartoons. Was it a good year for you, Doug
498	00:31:43.180	00:31:47.270	Marlette? Oh, yeah. An election year is always good, and,
499	00:31:47.280	00:31:49.440	you know, actually most years are good. It feels like
500	00:31:49.450	00:31:51.190	we're talking about a wine. You know, it was a
501	00:31:51.200	00:31:53.780	vintage year for cartoons. And, of course, it was a
502	00:31:53.790	00:31:55.540	good year for you. It probably wasn't a good year
503	00:31:55.550	00:31:57.540	for everybody else. That's exactly right. That's one of the
504	00:31:57.550	00:32:02.440	ironies of our business is in the chuckles racket as
505	00:32:02.450	00:32:05.200	we call it, but you know, bad times for the
506	00:32:05.210	00:32:08.870	republic are good times for cartoonists. So we are--we
507	00:32:08.880	00:32:13.270	had a good year. The election made it especially easy.
508	00:32:13.280	00:32:15.420	When I say easy, I mean that there are so
509	00:32:15.430	00:32:18.420	many topics coming at you, you end up drawing those
510	00:32:18.430	00:32:21.070	one-day wonders because it's such a relief not to be
511	00:32:21.080	00:32:24.780	drawing on the candidates. That's one of the reasons. You're
512	00:32:24.790	00:32:27.660	looking for something else. Ann Telnaes, how about for you?
513	00:32:27.670	00:32:29.380	Was it a rich year for you? Oh, it was
514	00:32:29.390	00:32:32.110	a great year for cartoonists. It was actually the first
515	00:32:32.120	00:32:35.060	time I had followed an election in my cartoons from
516	00:32:35.070	00:32:39.290	the primaries on. So I found it very interesting. I
517	00:32:39.300	00:32:42.110	mean, I loved drawing Bob Dole. I just--I'm kind
518	00:32:42.120	00:32:45.140	of very sad that he's gone now because he was
519	00:32:45.150	00:32:48.040	just such a wonderful character, and that Dole-speak was just
520	00:32:48.050	00:32:52.210	priceless. It offered a lot for us to work with.
521	00:32:52.220	00:32:54.120	Michael Ramirez, how would you rate it if you had
522	00:32:54.130	00:32:55.840	to rate this year on a scale of one to
523	00:32:55.850	00:32:58.070	ten? Well, I think it was pretty much near the
524	00:32:58.080	00:33:01.090	top. I think it's close to ten. Election years always
525	00:33:01.100	00:33:04.680	seem to be like Christmas all year around. And when
526	00:33:04.690	00:33:08.330	you have a multitude of candidates that garnered about as
527	00:33:08.340	00:33:11.740	much enthusiasm as watching the Rose Bowl seven times in
528	00:33:11.750	00:33:15.680	one day, or the Rose Bowl Parade, that generates great
529	00:33:15.690	00:33:19.350	editorial cartoons. And I think here we had a classic
530	00:33:19.360	00:33:24.850	election where neither candidate really generated much enthusiasm and, therefore,
531	00:33:24.860	00:33:28.350	they made great cartoon fodder. So I think it's been
532	00:33:28.360	00:33:30.760	a terrific year. Michael, let's look at one of your
533	00:33:30.770	00:33:33.970	cartoons from the elections and talk about it for a
534	00:33:33.980	00:33:37.300	minute. Here we have a bridge. Both ends of the
535	00:33:37.310	00:33:40.310	bridge are falling apart. On one end it says "Clinton
536	00:33:40.320	00:33:42.760	Bridge to the Future," on the other end "Dole Bridge
537	00:33:42.770	00:33:47.030	to the Past." And "Voters" in-between. Looking back, is this
538	00:33:47.040	00:33:50.350	how the elections still strike you? Yeah. I think I
539	00:33:50.360	00:33:53.630	pretty much characterized it literally how the voters felt about
540	00:33:53.640	00:33:56.160	the candidates. It seemed that they were kind of stuck
541	00:33:56.170	00:33:59.700	in this montage of the same old campaign rhetoric with
542	00:33:59.710	00:34:03.600	two candidates that didn't really represent what they're saying. And,
543	00:34:03.610	00:34:07.140	therefore, they didn't really have good choices. And I just
544	00:34:07.150	00:34:12.450	took the two campaign statements that both Bob Dole and
545	00:34:12.460	00:34:14.900	Bill Clinton use and just kind of fashioned it into
546	00:34:14.910	00:34:17.850	the cartoon where the voters were just stuck with no
547	00:34:17.860	00:34:21.290	real choice. Ann Telnaes, what's most memorable as you look
548	00:34:21.300	00:34:24.680	back now on the elections? I think the importance of
549	00:34:24.690	00:34:27.250	the moderate voter. I did a lot of cartoons regarding
550	00:34:27.260	00:34:29.170	that. Okay. Let me interrupt one second. Let's put one
551	00:34:29.180	00:34:34.110	up. Here you have Sen. Dole leaning towards I guess
552	00:34:34.120	00:34:35.970	a moderate voter, saying, "I want you to know I'm
553	00:34:35.980	00:34:38.930	very tolerant," but he's playing footsie with somebody to his
554	00:34:38.940	00:34:42.230	right, a woman who's labeled "Far Right." Yeah. That was
555	00:34:42.240	00:34:46.010	at the point in the campaign where the Dole team
556	00:34:46.020	00:34:48.640	finally realized they were really behind in the polls with
557	00:34:48.650	00:34:52.140	women voters, and, you know, they started trotting out a
558	00:34:52.150	00:34:57.410	few moderate Republican congresswomen to tell everyone how tolerant the
559	00:34:57.420	00:35:00.620	party actually was. And, you know, if you followed anything
560	00:35:00.630	00:35:06.440	from the primaries on with Pat Buchanan and Bob Doran,
561	00:35:06.450	00:35:08.500	you had to kind of laugh at that. I found
562	00:35:08.510	00:35:10.860	it very amusing, so that was the reason I did
563	00:35:10.870	00:35:14.510	that cartoon. Doug Marlette, how about you? The First Lady
564	00:35:14.520	00:35:18.450	and Mrs. Dole, who wanted to be First Lady, gave
565	00:35:18.460	00:35:22.170	you some laughs, didn't they? Oh, yeah. Both First Ladies
566	00:35:22.180	00:35:24.620	were terrific for us. They were more interesting than the
567	00:35:24.630	00:35:27.800	candidates. Let's look at what you did with it. Here
568	00:35:27.810	00:35:31.570	we have a cartoon. This is the Doles in bed.
569	00:35:31.580	00:35:35.000	Mrs. Dole is completely dressed, and she's speaking into a
570	00:35:35.010	00:35:37.590	microphone, and the Senator is saying, "Give it a rest,
571	00:35:37.600	00:35:40.210	Liddy!" Yeah. This is right after the convention. Before we
572	00:35:40.220	00:35:42.320	go on, let me just look at one more, and
573	00:35:42.330	00:35:45.010	then we'll talk about him. Here we have the Clintons
574	00:35:45.020	00:35:48.830	in bed, and the President looks kind of like Franklin
575	00:35:48.840	00:35:52.120	Delano Roosevelt, and Mrs. Clinton is saying, "Eleanor says to
576	00:35:52.130	00:35:54.120	knock it off, Bill!" Let's start with that one. Tell
577	00:35:54.130	00:35:55.610	us about that one. Well, you know, first of all,
578	00:35:55.620	00:35:57.710	you always want to draw the candidates in bed, whenever
579	00:35:57.720	00:36:01.210	possible. There's a rule for political cartoons; that it humanizes
580	00:36:01.220	00:36:04.240	them, or you know, in the bathroom, any of the
581	00:36:04.250	00:36:12.590	human parts of the house. But, you know, with Hillary
582	00:36:12.600	00:36:16.850	saying, "Eleanor says to knock it off, Bill," that was
583	00:36:16.860	00:36:19.500	after the election, and Clinton had won, was looking like
584	00:36:19.510	00:36:23.670	Roosevelt, and this whole thing fascinated me of Hillary Clinton
585	00:36:23.680	00:36:27.900	becoming this new age, talking to Eleanor Roosevelt, and I
586	00:36:27.910	00:36:31.220	couldn't help but associate to Nancy Reagan, who is another
587	00:36:31.230	00:36:35.170	one of the kind of rigid seeming, you know, dominatrix
588	00:36:35.180	00:36:39.360	kinds of First Ladies who always seem to have these
589	00:36:39.370	00:36:43.710	weird fascinations with the occult and with, you know, stargazing
590	00:36:43.720	00:36:50.310	and astrology or--you know, I enjoyed going at something
591	00:36:50.320	00:36:54.350	from the side of pulling out an old issue and
592	00:36:54.360	00:36:58.080	bringing it up. But having the wives of both candidates
593	00:36:58.090	00:37:01.480	were really interesting. As a matter of fact, what I
594	00:37:01.490	00:37:07.180	found most interesting was how Clinton, the genius of this
595	00:37:07.190	00:37:10.520	election, and the victory this year was of Clinton finding
596	00:37:10.530	00:37:15.210	Hillary to carry his problems with Whitewater and then Dick
597	00:37:15.220	00:37:18.450	Morris to carry that, you know, that kind of part
598	00:37:18.460	00:37:22.760	of him that is more--how would we say--promiscuous
599	00:37:22.770	00:37:26.150	part of the President. And so he found designated, you
600	00:37:26.160	00:37:30.510	know, problem folks who served as lightning rods, so he
601	00:37:30.520	00:37:32.790	kind of got off the radar, and these people were
602	00:37:32.800	00:37:35.000	seen that way. I did a drawing after the Morris
603	00:37:35.010	00:37:38.100	thing where Clinton is saying, you know, "Imagine my surprise
604	00:37:38.110	00:37:43.310	when it wasn't me." Before we go on to your
605	00:37:43.320	00:37:46.910	cartoon, Steve Kelley, this idea of putting the candidates in
606	00:37:46.920	00:37:50.310	bed or in some intimate kind of setting, does everybody
607	00:37:50.320	00:37:52.400	find that that's funny, or is this just your own
608	00:37:52.410	00:37:56.850	peculiar--You know, basically we tend to idealize candidates and
609	00:37:56.860	00:37:59.410	presidents, and part of the role of the cartoonist is
610	00:37:59.420	00:38:00.970	to humanize. Do you agree with that? In addition, one
611	00:38:00.980	00:38:05.280	of the few true advantages that political cartoonists have over
612	00:38:05.290	00:38:07.940	say photographers or columnists is that they "can" put the
613	00:38:07.950	00:38:11.100	candidates in bed. I mean, no photographer could go in
614	00:38:11.110	00:38:14.020	and snap a picture, a columnist might describe it, but
615	00:38:14.030	00:38:16.580	not nearly as well. I mean, we can depict the
616	00:38:16.590	00:38:19.910	President or First Lady in bed, if we want, and
617	00:38:19.920	00:38:23.380	I think that alone is--it just startles the reader,
618	00:38:23.390	00:38:27.080	and it's interesting just to see what someone--how someone
619	00:38:27.090	00:38:31.700	would conceive it. It's very startling, I agree. Yes, go
620	00:38:31.710	00:38:35.280	ahead. Our job as editorial cartoonists is really to point
621	00:38:35.290	00:38:39.740	out that politicians are fallible, that they do make mistakes.
622	00:38:39.750	00:38:41.850	I think it was kind of interesting that Doug had
623	00:38:41.860	00:38:45.190	FDR there. I think the Social Security outlays that they
624	00:38:45.200	00:38:48.940	predicted in 1980 were $1.3 billion. They missed it by
625	00:38:48.950	00:38:51.250	$290 billion. So we get to put 'em in a
626	00:38:51.260	00:38:55.750	situation where they might not be to show the people
627	00:38:55.760	00:38:58.640	that they're more human, the politicians are more human, and
628	00:38:58.650	00:39:00.760	that they are fallible. And that's the whole point of
629	00:39:00.770	00:39:04.670	editorial cartooning. Steve, sticking with the elections, looking back, the
630	00:39:04.680	00:39:07.480	scandals gave you quite a bit of fodder. Well, the
631	00:39:07.490	00:39:09.660	trouble was keeping up with the scandals. I mean, especially
632	00:39:09.670	00:39:11.520	in the White House, I mean it seemed that they
633	00:39:11.530	00:39:13.850	came virtually every week. And it was almost--Excuse me
634	00:39:13.860	00:39:15.870	one second. Let's look at this cartoon. Here we have
635	00:39:15.880	00:39:18.010	the White House with the sign outside that's sort of
636	00:39:18.020	00:39:21.370	like the sign outside a bank. It says, "Time 1:17,
637	00:39:21.380	00:39:25.240	Temperature 85 degrees, Current Scandal: FBI Files." Right. That was
638	00:39:25.250	00:39:26.880	just the current scandal. I mean, that was the fourth
639	00:39:26.890	00:39:31.660	in a long series of scandals. And, you know, this
640	00:39:31.670	00:39:33.700	was--it was almost like a shell game that the
641	00:39:33.710	00:39:36.150	White House, or it seemed like that, like they were
642	00:39:36.160	00:39:38.590	trying to--okay, well, everybody is talking about this scandal.
643	00:39:38.600	00:39:41.510	Now, quick, start another fire over here, and let's--we'll
644	00:39:41.520	00:39:43.120	get 'em talking about that, and before they can really
645	00:39:43.130	00:39:45.700	get any meat there, then we'll send them over to
646	00:39:45.710	00:39:49.160	another one over here. It was--you know, and also
647	00:39:49.170	00:39:53.250	very good fodder for, for cartoonists, just, you know, any
648	00:39:53.260	00:39:56.210	presidential scandal at all is great, but to have, you
649	00:39:56.220	00:40:01.770	know, to have a six-pack is, it was nice. Okay.
650	00:40:01.780	00:40:06.170	Let's look at four cartoons now on other issues, and
651	00:40:06.180	00:40:07.970	we're going to go through these one at a time.
652	00:40:07.980	00:40:12.640	Here's Steve Kelley's take on Roberto Alomar, the Baltimore Orioles'
653	00:40:12.650	00:40:15.350	player who spit on an umpire, and there's the umpire
654	00:40:15.360	00:40:19.470	in his deep sea diving gear. And next, we see
655	00:40:19.480	00:40:24.320	an Ann Telnaes cartoon on the First Lady. There's the
656	00:40:24.330	00:40:28.930	elephant, sitting and reading a bedtime story. He says, "And
657	00:40:28.940	00:40:31.540	the bad, uppity woman was forced to leave Washington in
658	00:40:31.550	00:40:34.780	disgrace, while the angry white males breathed a sigh of
659	00:40:34.790	00:40:38.060	relief and lived happily ever after." And the males in
660	00:40:38.070	00:40:42.140	bed are saying, "Read it again! Read it again!" And
661	00:40:42.150	00:40:45.310	next, we have a Doug Marlette cartoon. This is about
662	00:40:45.320	00:40:48.210	drugs and the baby boomers: "My folks warned me about
663	00:40:48.220	00:40:50.490	the dangers of drugs, but they may have been having
664	00:40:50.500	00:40:54.580	an acid flashback at the time!" And then finally, we
665	00:40:54.590	00:40:58.110	have a Michael Ramirez cartoon about violence on TV: The
666	00:40:58.120	00:41:00.750	mother's saying, "Son, your Father and I have decided not
667	00:41:00.760	00:41:04.030	to let you watch TV anymore because it promotes violence..."
668	00:41:04.040	00:41:06.490	And the son's saying, "Touch my remote and I'll kill
669	00:41:06.500	00:41:12.080	you..." Michael Ramirez, how did you--what made you decide
670	00:41:12.090	00:41:14.290	to do that cartoon? What does it? What comes to
671	00:41:14.300	00:41:17.320	your mind? Well, you know, it's the irony in daily
672	00:41:17.330	00:41:20.920	life that I think makes the best cartoons. In this
673	00:41:20.930	00:41:25.940	case, you know, obviously parental guidance is well and good
674	00:41:25.950	00:41:30.230	in making sure that your kids are watching what they're
675	00:41:30.240	00:41:33.060	supposed to be watching, but does television violence really affect
676	00:41:33.070	00:41:36.140	our children? And I think the question was answered obviously
677	00:41:36.150	00:41:39.530	by the kid exhibiting violent behavior. And I think those
678	00:41:39.540	00:41:43.470	kind of ironies in real life, they tend to be
679	00:41:43.480	00:41:46.610	great editorial cartoons. Is that what moves you too, Ann,
680	00:41:46.620	00:41:51.410	those ironies? Yes. It's usually something I've been thinking about,
681	00:41:51.420	00:41:53.510	something that I've been thinking about for a while. And
682	00:41:53.520	00:41:56.110	somebody will, you know, say something or have a press
683	00:41:56.120	00:41:58.860	conference that just sounds so absurd to me that I
684	00:41:58.870	00:42:02.290	just have to do a cartoon that minute. And the
685	00:42:02.300	00:42:05.080	one that you showed, you know, that was a result
686	00:42:05.090	00:42:08.790	of the fact that Senator D'Amato had just finished the
687	00:42:08.800	00:42:13.490	Whitewater hearings, and they had called a press conference, and
688	00:42:13.500	00:42:16.000	it just seemed so absurd to me. They had all
689	00:42:16.010	00:42:18.430	these white men standing up there, all these Republican white
690	00:42:18.440	00:42:22.450	men, and each one took their turns in bashing Hillary
691	00:42:22.460	00:42:25.780	basically, and, you know, you just, you feel compelled to
692	00:42:25.790	00:42:28.260	do a cartoon about it. And you want to show
693	00:42:28.270	00:42:30.910	them in the most ridiculous light possible. Is that the
694	00:42:30.920	00:42:32.710	way it works for you, or do you have a
695	00:42:32.720	00:42:36.760	different inspiration process? You know, I think it's just, you
696	00:42:36.770	00:42:40.860	feel these contradictions, you know, and showing them the cartoon
697	00:42:40.870	00:42:44.820	about the baby boomer, the children of the baby boomers
698	00:42:44.830	00:42:48.760	talking about drugs, we live in such a "feel good"
699	00:42:48.770	00:42:54.190	culture, and it's drug-oriented, and approaching--you know, now baby
700	00:42:54.200	00:42:56.700	boomers are dealing with their children--you know, "Did you
701	00:42:56.710	00:42:59.600	do drugs, Daddy," you know, "What was it like at
702	00:42:59.610	00:43:03.200	Woodstock?"--having to deal with that, and I could have
703	00:43:03.210	00:43:05.310	done a cartoon saying--I could have done the same
704	00:43:05.320	00:43:08.970	drawing and had the--had the kid saying, you know,
705	00:43:08.980	00:43:12.040	my parents warned me about drugs, but I don't know
706	00:43:12.050	00:43:18.240	if it was them or the Prozac talking. And Steve
707	00:43:18.250	00:43:21.140	Kelley, what about the Alomar cartoon, did you do that
708	00:43:21.150	00:43:23.690	right away after the spitting incident occurred, or did you
709	00:43:23.700	00:43:26.190	think about it for a while? Well, it ran a
710	00:43:26.200	00:43:28.610	couple of days afterwards. What I try to do is
711	00:43:28.620	00:43:31.790	determine essentially what people are talking about at lunch that
712	00:43:31.800	00:43:34.530	day and let that be sort of my guide for
713	00:43:34.540	00:43:38.180	what I address, and the great thing about that is
714	00:43:38.190	00:43:41.310	people actually are looking for a cartoon on the subject.
715	00:43:41.320	00:43:43.350	I mean, I'll many times have people say to me,
716	00:43:43.360	00:43:45.510	I was wondering what you were going to do about
717	00:43:45.520	00:43:49.080	this event. And like with the Alomar event, it was
718	00:43:49.090	00:43:52.200	so out of the ordinary that a professional baseball player
719	00:43:52.210	00:43:56.310	would spit in the face of an umpire, of authority.
720	00:43:56.320	00:43:59.470	And so everyone was focused on that, so any cartoon
721	00:43:59.480	00:44:01.940	that I drew about it not only was going to
722	00:44:01.950	00:44:04.370	receive a lot of readers, a lot of people were
723	00:44:04.380	00:44:06.340	going to look at it, but they were expecting it.
724	00:44:06.350	00:44:08.360	They wanted to know what I was going to say
725	00:44:08.370	00:44:11.120	about that, and when the cartoon came out, I got
726	00:44:11.130	00:44:12.850	a lot of phone calls on it, people who were
727	00:44:12.860	00:44:16.090	very happy about it. And then again we can't in
728	00:44:16.100	00:44:20.170	television or print journalists can't talk about the umpire, you
729	00:44:20.180	00:44:21.780	know, putting him in some kind of a deep sea
730	00:44:21.790	00:44:23.760	outfit. Well, once again, it gets back to the strength
731	00:44:23.770	00:44:27.090	of political cartooning, which is you can create something that
732	00:44:27.100	00:44:31.060	could never appear in physical life really. No photographer could
733	00:44:31.070	00:44:33.680	have taken a picture of that. It was purely a
734	00:44:33.690	00:44:37.150	cartoonist's creation. And there's also an element--and this is
735	00:44:37.160	00:44:39.380	the art of cartoons I think--is that if you
736	00:44:39.390	00:44:44.050	can hit like with a certain inevitability where a cartoon
737	00:44:44.060	00:44:46.910	is so natural that people feel like, of course, and
738	00:44:46.920	00:44:49.670	you're saying it for them, that's what you're kind of
739	00:44:49.680	00:44:53.010	looking for. It's harder--it's hard to find those ideas,
740	00:44:53.020	00:44:55.170	but that's what you're really after, like a hole in
741	00:44:55.180	00:44:58.280	one. Ann, which of your cartoons was the most controversial?
742	00:44:58.290	00:45:01.330	And by that, I mean which one inspired the most
743	00:45:01.340	00:45:07.480	reaction, letters, outcry? It was the working woman holding the
744	00:45:07.490	00:45:11.350	fan, and it was making the mud go back on
745	00:45:11.360	00:45:14.770	the Hillary bashers. We're looking at it right now, and
746	00:45:14.780	00:45:20.260	you can see the woman is labeled "Working Woman." Right.
747	00:45:20.270	00:45:22.920	I put my E-mail address on my cartoons, and I
748	00:45:22.930	00:45:25.580	get a lot of reactions that way. And that cartoon,
749	00:45:25.590	00:45:28.830	that got, you know, a very pro and con reaction.
750	00:45:28.840	00:45:30.960	I mean, some people were like, good for you, you
751	00:45:30.970	00:45:34.660	know, we're so tired of this bashing, and the other
752	00:45:34.670	00:45:37.220	side, you know, I had people writing in, you know,
753	00:45:37.230	00:45:39.710	we bash Hillary because she's a liar and proceeded to
754	00:45:39.720	00:45:42.080	call her many, many names and proceeded to call me
755	00:45:42.090	00:45:46.250	many names, and it created quite a response. Which was
756	00:45:46.260	00:45:49.370	your most controversial cartoon? Anything that I do on the
757	00:45:49.380	00:45:52.500	O.J. Simpson trial seems to be--seems to get me
758	00:45:52.510	00:45:54.540	a lot of mail. I did one of Simpson as
759	00:45:54.550	00:45:56.960	a pilgrim. And this was if O.J. had been a
760	00:45:56.970	00:46:00.090	pilgrim, and he's saying, I didn't do it. You know,
761	00:46:00.100	00:46:02.350	people always, they call up and they're angry that you're
762	00:46:02.360	00:46:04.970	second-guessing the work of a jury. They say, you know,
763	00:46:04.980	00:46:07.280	I guess you think you know better than these 12
764	00:46:07.290	00:46:09.260	people, and I typically go, yeah, as a matter of
765	00:46:09.270	00:46:12.550	fact, I think I probably do. Do you all like
766	00:46:12.560	00:46:14.530	it when you get these kind of responses? I mean,
767	00:46:14.540	00:46:16.180	do you like it when do one that gets lots
768	00:46:16.190	00:46:18.910	of mail? Yes, certainly. Yeah. That's a sign you've been
769	00:46:18.920	00:46:22.380	very successful. Absolutely. Yeah. And to the meaner the responses.
770	00:46:22.390	00:46:26.740	You know, it's easy to do that. You can get
771	00:46:26.750	00:46:30.940	response. But getting response when people--when you placed it
772	00:46:30.950	00:46:33.930	where you want it, like a good tennis serve--and
773	00:46:33.940	00:46:38.140	getting the reaction, that means you're being effective. Michael Ramirez,
774	00:46:38.150	00:46:41.580	which was your most controversial cartoon? My most controversial one
775	00:46:41.590	00:46:44.360	this year was I had a piano with the keys
776	00:46:44.370	00:46:46.410	separated. I had the black keys on one side and
777	00:46:46.420	00:46:47.930	the white keys on the other side. It was kind
778	00:46:47.940	00:46:51.890	of an offshoot of the O.J. Simpson trial, and sort
779	00:46:51.900	00:46:56.790	of racial tension that's evolved in America. And it was
780	00:46:56.800	00:46:59.730	titled "Playing the Blues," and it sort of talks about
781	00:46:59.740	00:47:04.870	the resegregationist movement that we have, kind of multiculturalism versus
782	00:47:04.880	00:47:08.920	fractionalization. You know, getting back to--Excuse me just one
783	00:47:08.930	00:47:11.290	second. Why do you think this one elicited so much
784	00:47:11.300	00:47:13.520	response? Why was it your most controversial? Well, you know,
785	00:47:13.530	00:47:17.290	being in Memphis, Tennessee, politics is very volatile to begin
786	00:47:17.300	00:47:20.300	with, but then when you get the racial element into
787	00:47:20.310	00:47:24.160	any equation, it becomes much more so. So any time
788	00:47:24.170	00:47:27.050	you start raising the issue of race, it seems to
789	00:47:27.060	00:47:31.480	drive the telephones and bring in the hate mail. And
790	00:47:31.490	00:47:34.330	in this case, it's an area of sensitivity in our
791	00:47:34.340	00:47:38.170	community because of course Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated
792	00:47:38.180	00:47:41.970	in Memphis, and so any derivative subject in race will
793	00:47:41.980	00:47:44.140	bring a lot of criticism. And I interrupted you. You
794	00:47:44.150	00:47:46.860	wanted to say something else. You know, editorial cartoons are
795	00:47:46.870	00:47:49.690	sort of a mirror of events, though. I mean, we're
796	00:47:49.700	00:47:52.760	pretty much, you know, politics by its nature is very
797	00:47:52.770	00:47:55.100	volatile. So, the hate mail that we get, we wear
798	00:47:55.110	00:47:58.030	'em sort of like medals, you know. If we do
799	00:47:58.040	00:48:00.550	generate hate mail, if we're getting criticism, if we're getting
800	00:48:00.560	00:48:03.250	phone calls, then we're doing our job. What was your
801	00:48:03.260	00:48:07.090	most controversial cartoon, Doug? You know, I had no controversial
802	00:48:07.100	00:48:09.900	cartoons this year. I had had so many before this
803	00:48:09.910	00:48:11.650	year that I got the year off. But I thought
804	00:48:11.660	00:48:13.380	when you were going to ask us what was the
805	00:48:13.390	00:48:17.720	most controversial subject or topic, which was for me, was
806	00:48:17.730	00:48:21.640	who was the father of Madonna's child, that was the
807	00:48:21.650	00:48:24.800	controversy that riveted me. And the second thing was, who
808	00:48:24.810	00:48:29.820	was the father of Michael Jackson's child? But you did
809	00:48:29.830	00:48:31.810	also do a cartoon on race, did you not? Yes,
810	00:48:31.820	00:48:35.100	I did. That elicited a lot of response. Yes. Describe
811	00:48:35.110	00:48:38.920	it. I think we can see it now. This actually
812	00:48:38.930	00:48:45.340	got a positive reaction, as opposed to the--You can
813	00:48:45.350	00:48:48.450	see the church burning and it's, "In my day they
814	00:48:48.460	00:48:52.110	just burned the cross!" Right. I got a lot of
815	00:48:52.120	00:48:55.660	positive reaction, actually, on this cartoon, and this always surprises
816	00:48:55.670	00:48:58.600	me. You never know. You get used to hate mail
817	00:48:58.610	00:49:02.980	and petitions that you be fired and, you know, but
818	00:49:02.990	00:49:08.480	sometimes things hit, and you can get positive reaction. Itâ€™s
819	00:49:08.490	00:49:12.560	interesting. You never know. And it's always interesting. Is that
820	00:49:12.570	00:49:14.690	true for all of you, you just can't predict it?
821	00:49:14.700	00:49:16.700	No. You can't. And when you don't get a reaction,
822	00:49:16.710	00:49:19.440	then you're kind of I guess it really didn't generate
823	00:49:19.450	00:49:23.120	any discussion, so, yeah, you want that reaction. Steve, what
824	00:49:23.130	00:49:26.300	are you sharpening your quill for, thinking of next year?
825	00:49:26.310	00:49:29.640	Against whom are you sharpening your quill? It's interesting. Every
826	00:49:29.650	00:49:32.800	time I take a vacation from work--I took off
827	00:49:32.810	00:49:37.040	a week for Christmas, and inevitably, some big news event--
828	00:49:37.050	00:49:39.030	you just wait for that. It's one of the laws
829	00:49:39.040	00:49:43.420	of the cartoonists' universe. And I guess Newt Gingrich's mea
830	00:49:43.430	00:49:47.800	culpa will eventually, I will be drawing cartoons about that
831	00:49:47.810	00:49:53.100	and certainly about the second term, the Clinton second term,
832	00:49:53.110	00:49:57.190	and I guess the line-item veto is now going to--
833	00:49:57.200	00:50:01.540	that will be a different spin on the budget process.
834	00:50:01.550	00:50:03.610	How about you? Whenever there are subpoenas in the air,
835	00:50:03.620	00:50:05.640	you know, you know it's going to be a good
836	00:50:05.650	00:50:07.560	time for cartoonists. But, you know, we all set our--
837	00:50:07.570	00:50:08.790	as a matter of fact, we watch for when Steve
838	00:50:08.800	00:50:10.500	is going to go on vacation because we know that
839	00:50:10.510	00:50:14.130	a big topic is coming--is coming down the pike.
840	00:50:14.140	00:50:15.800	Ann, what about you? What are you thinking about for
841	00:50:15.810	00:50:20.380	next year? Probably China, China and Hong Kong I think
842	00:50:20.390	00:50:22.150	I'm going to be doing a lot of cartoons. I
843	00:50:22.160	00:50:25.930	try to do them now, but I think the editors
844	00:50:25.940	00:50:30.570	will be wanting them this year, and also, well, the
845	00:50:30.580	00:50:33.050	scandals, that'll be nice. That will be something good. And
846	00:50:33.060	00:50:35.720	Michael Ramirez, briefly. Well, I think, you know, the Clinton
847	00:50:35.730	00:50:38.720	administration is going to be a lovely topic of conversation
848	00:50:38.730	00:50:40.830	for years to come. When I went to vote for
849	00:50:40.840	00:50:43.260	him, I couldn't decide whether to vote for national security
850	00:50:43.270	00:50:45.320	or job security. And I'm sure in the next year
851	00:50:45.330	00:50:48.450	they're going to provide lots of cartoon fodder. Well, thank
852	00:50:48.460	00:50:50.540	you all very much. We'll look forward to seeing your
853	00:50:50.550	00:50:52.190	cartoons next year. And thank you for being with us.
854	00:50:52.200	00:51:05.860	Happy New Year! Finally tonight essayist Richard Rodriguez, editor of
855	00:51:05.870	00:51:08.350	the "Pacific News Service," has some thoughts about a new
856	00:51:08.360	00:51:14.430	movie and its star. "Eva, Eva," chanted the crowd. Eva
857	00:51:14.440	00:51:17.600	Peron was for a time in the 40's and 50's
858	00:51:17.610	00:51:20.880	the first lady of Argentina, the most famous woman of
859	00:51:20.890	00:51:27.930	her time. Forty years later "Evita" is a movie starring
860	00:51:27.940	00:51:32.740	Madonna, the first lady of American rock. The American rock
861	00:51:32.750	00:51:37.040	star and the Argentine populist heroine, both lives are linked
862	00:51:37.050	00:51:42.890	by odd similarities. Eva Peron was born Marie Eva Duarte,
863	00:51:42.900	00:51:45.780	the illegitimate daughter of a seamstress and a rancher in
864	00:51:45.790	00:51:51.220	rural Argentina. At 15, Eva Duarte traveled alone to Buenos
865	00:51:51.230	00:51:54.730	Aires, there to begin an undistinguished career as an actress
866	00:51:54.740	00:51:58.030	and singer. When she met Juan Peron in a night
867	00:51:58.040	00:52:01.770	club, he was twice her age, an army colonel with
868	00:52:01.780	00:52:07.010	an admiration for Franco and Hitler. Madonna is a celebrity,
869	00:52:07.020	00:52:09.420	famous not so much for her singing voice or her
870	00:52:09.430	00:52:13.040	acting talent as for her ability to keep modeling and
871	00:52:13.050	00:52:18.080	remodeling herself. She has become a female icon for a
872	00:52:18.090	00:52:22.430	fierce determination to keep changing. Look at the crowds that
873	00:52:22.440	00:52:25.740	come to see her perform. Crowds at rock concerts now
874	00:52:25.750	00:52:29.400	are the most extraordinary crowds in the world. Politicians all
875	00:52:29.410	00:52:33.180	over must look at such audiences with envy. What politician
876	00:52:33.190	00:52:36.900	in the world today can command this sort of audience?
877	00:52:36.910	00:52:42.290	Eva Peron knew such crowds. Fifty years ago, Argentina was
878	00:52:42.300	00:52:46.540	hers. Argentina has always struck me as a country in
879	00:52:46.550	00:52:50.210	search of a nation. In the 19th century European settlers
880	00:52:50.220	00:52:52.140	wiped out nearly all trace of the Indian from the
881	00:52:52.150	00:52:57.300	land. Even Luis Borges, Argentina's greatest writer of this century,
882	00:52:57.310	00:52:59.470	blind Borges used to laugh at what he supposed was
883	00:52:59.480	00:53:04.870	the Indians' backwardness. Such a sad land. For most of
884	00:53:04.880	00:53:07.420	the century Argentina has flirted with strong men of the
885	00:53:07.430	00:53:12.560	left and the right. Lacking a democratic tradition, Argentina was
886	00:53:12.570	00:53:17.210	readily romanced by a strong man's promise of order, "orden,"
887	00:53:17.220	00:53:20.700	that most luxuriant of words in the political lexicon of
888	00:53:20.710	00:53:26.540	Latin American Spanish. Whereas, rock music is America's hymn to
889	00:53:26.550	00:53:32.590	disorder, rock is democracy on speed, do your own thing.
890	00:53:32.600	00:53:37.110	To that extent rock music is anti-political and necessarily skeptical
891	00:53:37.120	00:53:41.720	of the established order. When Elvis Presley visited Richard Nixon's
892	00:53:41.730	00:53:46.520	White House, the two men seemed from different planets. Rock
893	00:53:46.530	00:53:51.070	music is less about saying something than about unsaying it.
894	00:53:51.080	00:53:55.830	Country music, by contrast, even thuggish rap music communicate with
895	00:53:55.840	00:54:02.550	narrative. The most interesting idea I've ever heard Madonna express
896	00:54:02.560	00:54:10.830	was a necessity of striking a pose. Eva Peron became
897	00:54:10.840	00:54:15.190	a genuine populist heroine. She was of the poor, and
898	00:54:15.200	00:54:19.110	they, she grandly insisted, were of her. She had no
899	00:54:19.120	00:54:24.160	ideas. She had only a set of sentimental speeches everyone
900	00:54:24.170	00:54:29.160	had heard several times. While Juan Peron arrested journalists and
901	00:54:29.170	00:54:34.320	political rivals, Eva became a political heroine whose fame derived
902	00:54:34.330	00:54:38.730	from dying her hair blond and wearing Christian Dior. With
903	00:54:38.740	00:54:42.220	a beautician's help and a hairdresser's skill, Evita was a
904	00:54:42.230	00:54:46.930	golden fairy godmother to a yearning Argentina. In Buenos Aires,
905	00:54:46.940	00:54:49.670	as in every town and village throughout Argentina, there is
906	00:54:49.680	00:54:53.290	mourning for the First Lady of the land, Eva Peron.
907	00:54:53.300	00:54:57.390	She died young, at 33, from uterine cancer. In death,
908	00:54:57.400	00:55:01.530	Eva Peron became a saintly relic. I am only a
909	00:55:01.540	00:55:07.940	simple woman. In the 1970's, Eva was resurrected as "Evita,"
910	00:55:07.950	00:55:11.380	a pop opera by Andrew Lloyd Weber, which is where
911	00:55:11.390	00:55:15.650	we find her now, "Evita," the movie, played by Madonna,
912	00:55:15.660	00:55:21.080	the rock singer whose most astonishing achievement is reinventing herself.
913	00:55:21.090	00:55:25.150	In early December Bloomingdale's opened Evita boutiques in all of
914	00:55:25.160	00:55:30.480	its department stores. Here, you could buy Evita lipstick, dresses,
915	00:55:30.490	00:55:37.010	jewelry, all to create "the look." "Don't cry for me,
916	00:55:37.020	00:55:43.990	Argentina." Perhaps because of the restrictions women have lived with
917	00:55:44.000	00:55:47.700	for centuries it would necessarily occur to a woman to
918	00:55:47.710	00:55:52.240	realize the importance of costume and image. And yet, there
919	00:55:52.250	00:55:56.920	is something very terrible and very modern about the bottle-blond
920	00:55:56.930	00:56:00.810	fame of Eva Peron and Madonna. It is possible now
921	00:56:00.820	00:56:05.680	in our celebrity-obsessed world to become very influential by merely
922	00:56:05.690	00:56:13.390	striking a pose. "Don't cry for me, Argentina." I'm Richard
923	00:56:13.400	00:56:24.760	Rodriguez. Again, the major stories of this holiday, the terrorists
924	00:56:24.770	00:56:28.710	holding hostages in Lima, Peru, released seven more this evening.
925	00:56:28.720	00:56:32.150	No explanation was given for the release. An Israeli soldier
926	00:56:32.160	00:56:35.760	fired at shoppers in an Arab market in Hebron, wounding
927	00:56:35.770	00:56:39.170	five people. He said he wanted to sabotage the handover
928	00:56:39.180	00:56:43.130	of Hebron to the Palestinians. And a powerful New Year's
929	00:56:43.140	00:56:47.590	Day storm hit Washington, Oregon, and Northern California. Heavy rains
930	00:56:47.600	00:56:51.900	and high winds caused flooding, mud slides, and power outages.
931	00:56:51.910	00:56:54.950	We'll see you online and again here tomorrow evening. I'm
932	00:56:54.960	01:01:43.622	Jim Lehrer. Thank you, good night, and Happy New Year.
