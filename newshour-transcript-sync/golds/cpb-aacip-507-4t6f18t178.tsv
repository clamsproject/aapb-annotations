1	00:02:42.210	00:02:46.860	Good evening. Energy Secretary James Schlesinger today uttered the direst
2	00:02:46.870	00:02:50.990	warnings about the economic future unless the country replaces oil
3	00:02:51.000	00:02:54.550	with coal. Speaking in New York, Mr. Schlesinger said that
4	00:02:54.560	00:02:57.430	failure by U.S. business to increase its use of coal
5	00:02:57.440	00:03:00.830	over the next decade could cause the most severe economic
6	00:03:00.840	00:03:04.870	crisis since the Great Depression of the thirties. Ironically, as
7	00:03:04.880	00:03:08.380	he spoke, the nationwide coal strike, begun yesterday by the
8	00:03:08.390	00:03:12.690	United Mine Workers, began spreading to non-union mines. The union
9	00:03:12.700	00:03:16.300	comprises about seventy percent of the nation's miners and affects
10	00:03:16.310	00:03:20.080	about half of U.S. coal production. But union pickets started
11	00:03:20.090	00:03:24.730	closing non-union mines today in Ohio, Maryland and Kentucky, and
12	00:03:24.740	00:03:27.070	there were plans to extend the picketing to West Virginia
13	00:03:27.080	00:03:31.120	and Virginia. Mine Workers` President, Arnold Miller, said today that
14	00:03:31.130	00:03:34.650	the nation's soft coal producers want a one-month strike to
15	00:03:34.660	00:03:37.610	drive up prices and to weaken the union, but they
16	00:03:37.620	00:03:40.920	may get a walkout of three to four months instead.
17	00:03:40.930	00:03:43.600	Tonight, the meaning and the cost of the mine workers`
18	00:03:43.610	00:03:47.100	strike. Jim? Robin, money is not the issue in this
19	00:03:47.110	00:03:49.270	strike--at least, not money that comes in the form
20	00:03:49.280	00:03:53.020	of wages. The real sticking point is the so-called "wildcat"
21	00:03:53.030	00:03:56.500	option. The union is demanding the right for local unions
22	00:03:56.510	00:04:00.220	to strike single mines over local grievances. They could strike
23	00:04:00.230	00:04:02.930	only after a majority vote, and there would be provisions
24	00:04:02.940	00:04:05.550	to prevent them from spreading to other mines without further
25	00:04:05.560	00:04:09.150	votes. But management sees it as merely a legalizing of
26	00:04:09.160	00:04:13.090	wildcat strikes, something that has continually plagued the industry. They
27	00:04:13.100	00:04:16.700	are adamantly opposed to any such local option striking, and
28	00:04:16.710	00:04:19.950	in fact want provisions in the contract for docking pay
29	00:04:19.960	00:04:24.090	and otherwise discouraging single mine strikes. The other major issue
30	00:04:24.100	00:04:27.120	has to do with financing and restructuring the union's health
31	00:04:27.130	00:04:31.890	and retirement fund, which is now near bankruptcy. Robin? Jerry
32	00:04:31.900	00:04:34.530	Jones is a miner working for the Old Ben Coal
33	00:04:34.540	00:04:37.960	Company in Sesser--that's in southern Illinois. He's been a
34	00:04:37.970	00:04:41.770	miner for twelve years and is president of Local 1124
35	00:04:41.780	00:04:44.970	of District 12 of the United Mine Workers. The district
36	00:04:44.980	00:04:49.060	has between fourteen and sixteen thousand miners; Mr. Jones` local
37	00:04:49.070	00:04:54.780	oversees some 550 active members and 400 retired. Mr. Jones,
38	00:04:54.790	00:04:59.070	on the issues that Jim just outlined, which of the
39	00:04:59.080	00:05:01.910	three are most important to your members, the right to
40	00:05:01.920	00:05:05.870	strike over local grievances, increase in pay, or your health
41	00:05:05.880	00:05:09.990	and pension benefits? Well, Robin, first of all, I think
42	00:05:10.000	00:05:14.110	that the benefits are very important. Here's something that we've
43	00:05:14.120	00:05:18.650	always had, under the last two contracts, and suddenly six
44	00:05:18.660	00:05:21.080	months ago they've been taken away from us. Now that
45	00:05:21.090	00:05:23.430	puts us in a hole as far as going into
46	00:05:23.440	00:05:26.710	negotiations because here we're trying to negotiate something--President Miller
47	00:05:26.720	00:05:29.650	is--that we have always had; we're trying to get
48	00:05:29.660	00:05:33.520	back to be even before we ever start. To me,
49	00:05:33.530	00:05:37.880	this is a very important issue which actually shouldn't probably
50	00:05:37.890	00:05:40.520	even be at the negotiating table to begin with. These
51	00:05:40.530	00:05:44.310	benefits were taken away by some employers as a result
52	00:05:44.320	00:05:48.690	of a certain amount of wildcat strike, were they not?
53	00:05:48.700	00:05:51.590	This is what information the company has put out and
54	00:05:51.600	00:05:54.260	the press has reported. Actually, I don't agree with this
55	00:05:54.270	00:06:00.930	thing. In 1974 or late 1973, when this contract was
56	00:06:00.940	00:06:04.420	being negotiated, the one we're working under now, they took
57	00:06:04.430	00:06:07.660	in consideration the amount of coal that had been produced
58	00:06:07.670	00:06:11.310	in that year and they decided, here, we're going to
59	00:06:11.320	00:06:13.590	increase production, what we're going to do in the next
60	00:06:13.600	00:06:17.990	years to come under this present contract; so therefore we're
61	00:06:18.000	00:06:21.110	establishing our royalty fund, which is x number of dollars
62	00:06:21.120	00:06:26.420	per ton, plus so many dollars per man hours worked,
63	00:06:26.430	00:06:29.160	and then we're going to establish this fund to pay
64	00:06:29.170	00:06:33.760	the benefits and the health and retirement. So it's divided
65	00:06:33.770	00:06:36.990	into four different, separate funds. The 1950 plan, which is
66	00:06:37.000	00:06:40.710	the retirement fund that was in effect when it came
67	00:06:40.720	00:06:43.150	in in 1950 in the contract there, this is still
68	00:06:43.160	00:06:46.810	in. People on that fund draw like $225 a month.
69	00:06:46.820	00:06:48.680	I guess what you're saying is that they said the
70	00:06:48.690	00:06:51.390	more coal produced, the more money would go into the
71	00:06:51.400	00:06:56.450	funds. Well, my point is, they projected what would be
72	00:06:56.460	00:06:59.550	produced; in other words, an increase in production--and that
73	00:06:59.560	00:07:06.010	hasn't been so. The production has not increased. I think
74	00:07:06.020	00:07:08.400	there is a great number of reasons for this, and
75	00:07:08.410	00:07:11.780	they're always trying to lay that to the working miner.
76	00:07:11.790	00:07:13.980	To the wildcat strikes. Yes. But that isn't the only
77	00:07:13.990	00:07:16.630	reason, you think. No. Can I ask you one other
78	00:07:16.640	00:07:19.760	question? Your district did not support Arnold Miller in the
79	00:07:19.770	00:07:23.170	recent leadership election, they voted against him. But now you're
80	00:07:23.180	00:07:30.650	behind him in this strike. Can you explain, because the
81	00:07:30.660	00:07:33.660	owners have been saying, the operators have been saying that
82	00:07:33.670	00:07:37.970	Mr. Miller needed this strike himself to consolidate his leadership
83	00:07:37.980	00:07:43.360	of a disunited union. Well, in any election, whether it
84	00:07:43.370	00:07:46.570	be in labor or anywhere, you have two sides--or
85	00:07:46.580	00:07:50.560	this time we had three parties running. Actually, our district
86	00:07:50.570	00:07:53.720	supported Harry Patrick as secretary-treasurer, and he won--he got
87	00:07:53.730	00:07:56.570	the most votes in our district. But now let me
88	00:07:56.580	00:08:01.460	say that one of my close friends and fellow workers
89	00:08:01.470	00:08:03.740	did not support Arnold Miller; in fact, he went off
90	00:08:03.750	00:08:05.470	on a totally different slate, and he was very much
91	00:08:05.480	00:08:08.660	anti-Miller. But he made a statement to me the other
92	00:08:08.670	00:08:10.770	day that I thought summed it up pretty well. He
93	00:08:10.780	00:08:14.000	said that there was talk that they didn't want Arnold
94	00:08:14.010	00:08:17.080	to even be on the negotiating team because they said
95	00:08:17.090	00:08:19.450	he couldn't comprehend, he couldn't understand the contract language and
96	00:08:19.460	00:08:22.100	what was going on in negotiation. All right, if that
97	00:08:22.110	00:08:25.620	is so, then if they're going to write a contract
98	00:08:25.630	00:08:28.280	and send it down to us working miners, and if
99	00:08:28.290	00:08:30.040	he can't understand it there's no way we can work
100	00:08:30.050	00:08:32.610	with it, so we're going to get behind him. We've
101	00:08:32.620	00:08:35.760	got to get behind him. I see. We'll come back.
102	00:08:35.770	00:08:39.050	Jim? To further analyze where the union stands is a
103	00:08:39.060	00:08:41.950	man who has been active in coal labor management disputes
104	00:08:41.960	00:08:45.860	for several years, Thomas Bethell, a former United Mine Workers`
105	00:08:45.870	00:08:50.740	research director. He participated directly in their 1974 bargainings. He
106	00:08:50.750	00:08:55.720	is now editor of an industry publication called Coal Patrol.
107	00:08:55.730	00:08:59.540	Was this strike avoidable, Mr. Bethell? I really don't think
108	00:08:59.550	00:09:02.690	it was, but I don't think it's a strike that
109	00:09:02.700	00:09:05.650	was primarily provoked by the mine workers. I think that
110	00:09:05.660	00:09:08.540	the industry had a choice over the past two or
111	00:09:08.550	00:09:11.930	three years, as the situation developed and as labor relations
112	00:09:11.940	00:09:15.800	problems became more and more obviously severe, of whether they
113	00:09:15.810	00:09:17.940	were willing to come to the bargaining table with an
114	00:09:17.950	00:09:21.760	imaginative approach that would meet the needs of an obviously
115	00:09:21.770	00:09:27.160	very rapidly changing work force with changing expectations and demands.
116	00:09:27.170	00:09:29.470	Instead it's obvious, and more obvious every day, that the
117	00:09:29.480	00:09:32.780	industry came to the bargaining table not prepared for that
118	00:09:32.790	00:09:36.320	kind of approach but insisting on coming in with a
119	00:09:36.330	00:09:41.190	big club to go after a problem that simply is
120	00:09:41.200	00:09:45.330	not going to be resolved that way. Under the circumstances
121	00:09:45.340	00:09:49.800	it seems to me that any UMW president, be he
122	00:09:49.810	00:09:52.830	Mr. Miller or anybody else, would have been forced into
123	00:09:52.840	00:09:55.250	a situation where you now have the sides in a
124	00:09:55.260	00:09:59.190	strike. I think it was avoidable, but I think in
125	00:09:59.200	00:10:02.340	terms of the last several months, when people started focusing
126	00:10:02.350	00:10:04.520	some attention on it, no; by that time the damage
127	00:10:04.530	00:10:07.800	was done. All right. Mr. Jones laid out the basic
128	00:10:07.810	00:10:11.320	union position on the pension issue. Let's talk about the
129	00:10:11.330	00:10:14.240	wildcat issue, or the local strike issue, however you want
130	00:10:14.250	00:10:17.340	to phrase it. Is that a non-negotiable item from the
131	00:10:17.350	00:10:21.250	standpoint of the union? I suppose to an extent it's
132	00:10:21.260	00:10:24.350	true in any negotiations that any item is negotiable, but
133	00:10:24.360	00:10:28.250	the union has taken a very, very publicly strong stand
134	00:10:28.260	00:10:32.080	on winning this right. And it will be difficult for
135	00:10:32.090	00:10:34.400	the union to go back to its membership and get
136	00:10:34.410	00:10:37.650	ratification--this is only the second UMW contract that's had
137	00:10:37.660	00:10:42.700	membership ratification--without that demand in the contract unless the
138	00:10:42.710	00:10:46.000	contract is otherwise very, very solid. So to an extent
139	00:10:46.010	00:10:47.990	the union is locked in on that position. All right.
140	00:10:48.000	00:10:50.760	Now from the union standpoint, why is that so important,
141	00:10:50.770	00:10:54.650	the right to strike a local, single mine? Probably the
142	00:10:54.660	00:10:58.750	single most important reason is the overwhelmingly strong feeling on
143	00:10:58.760	00:11:01.270	the part of members of the union that there is
144	00:11:01.280	00:11:07.420	now no way to resolve a grievance speedily and fairly,
145	00:11:07.430	00:11:10.120	that it is all too easy for management simply to
146	00:11:10.130	00:11:13.260	postpone and postpone and postpone resolution of a grievance and
147	00:11:13.270	00:11:15.410	take it farther and farther away from the point of
148	00:11:15.420	00:11:17.460	production and more and more into the hands of people
149	00:11:17.470	00:11:19.140	who didn't really have anything to do with it in
150	00:11:19.150	00:11:23.650	the beginning; and that the local union and its members
151	00:11:23.660	00:11:27.960	have no effective penalty system to impose on management for
152	00:11:27.970	00:11:33.260	repeat violations of the contract. The right to strike could
153	00:11:33.270	00:11:35.340	be structured in such a way that it would not
154	00:11:35.350	00:11:39.210	be irresponsibly used. If it were structured in such a
155	00:11:39.220	00:11:43.400	way, I think, it would be used very, very rarely.
156	00:11:43.410	00:11:45.880	But it would be a clear-cut right to strike as
157	00:11:45.890	00:11:48.640	opposed to the complete mess that you have now, with
158	00:11:48.650	00:11:52.360	unauthorized strikes--strikes that are illegal under Supreme Court decisions
159	00:11:52.370	00:11:56.160	over the past several years. And everybody spends all their
160	00:11:56.170	00:11:57.810	time in courts as a result of it. Yeah, which
161	00:11:57.820	00:12:00.020	is obviously the last place to resolve these kinds of
162	00:12:00.030	00:12:03.460	things. Have the internal problems of the union itself, that
163	00:12:03.470	00:12:06.610	Robin just touched on with Mr. Jones--the election, the
164	00:12:06.620	00:12:09.760	whole thing with Arnold Miller reelected with forty percent of
165	00:12:09.770	00:12:13.770	the vote, and so on--have these affected the union's
166	00:12:13.780	00:12:17.690	bargaining position going into this? I think industry counted on
167	00:12:17.700	00:12:20.100	that happening; I'm not sure that it has happened. I
168	00:12:20.110	00:12:23.070	think that the very fact that the union members know
169	00:12:23.080	00:12:26.080	that they've been through a difficult time makes it doubly
170	00:12:26.090	00:12:28.610	important for them to stick together in the strike now
171	00:12:28.620	00:12:30.460	that the strike is under way, and the signs are
172	00:12:30.470	00:12:31.700	that they're going to do that and that they're going
173	00:12:31.710	00:12:34.490	to back Mr. Miller pretty strongly at the bargaining table.
174	00:12:34.500	00:12:37.450	I think industry has miscalculated that point. All right, thank
175	00:12:37.460	00:12:40.370	you. For a look now at management's side of the
176	00:12:40.380	00:12:44.530	dispute, a longtime observer of the coal industry, John Hoerr,
177	00:12:44.540	00:12:48.880	Labor Editor for Business Week magazine. How much does industry
178	00:12:48.890	00:12:52.100	stand to lose in this strike going in, Mr. Hoerr?
179	00:12:52.110	00:12:55.530	I think in terms of monetary loss, very little at
180	00:12:55.540	00:12:58.580	the beginning, because there is a tremendous amount of coal
181	00:12:58.590	00:13:03.210	already stockpiled. Utilities have between two to three months of
182	00:13:03.220	00:13:08.160	coal in the stockpiles; steel mills, two months. Data Resources
183	00:13:08.170	00:13:12.440	Incorporated, a consulting firm, recently did a study which indicates
184	00:13:12.450	00:13:15.440	that even if the strike had not occurred on December 6
185	00:13:15.450	00:13:19.850	the enormous stockpiles would have demanded a cut in production
186	00:13:19.860	00:13:24.430	of about twenty percent. So management stands not to lose
187	00:13:24.440	00:13:27.420	anything monetarily. I do think management stands to lose a
188	00:13:27.430	00:13:30.290	good deal in the labor relations sense if this does
189	00:13:30.300	00:13:34.260	become a bitter and prolonged conflict. In other words, there
190	00:13:34.270	00:13:37.350	would be no problem for a few weeks, but if
191	00:13:37.360	00:13:39.790	it got to be a prolonged strike for several months
192	00:13:39.800	00:13:42.050	then it could be very serious for them in the
193	00:13:42.060	00:13:44.740	industry...I'm saying it could be serious for them, I
194	00:13:44.750	00:13:50.460	think, in a human relations sense. Monetarily, once again, I
195	00:13:50.470	00:13:52.520	think a couple of months would not really hurt the
196	00:13:52.530	00:13:56.660	industry that much. All right. We talked about the internal
197	00:13:56.670	00:14:00.600	problems within the union. How unified is industry going into
198	00:14:00.610	00:14:05.530	this? Industry has its divisions. They are unified on what
199	00:14:05.540	00:14:09.360	they conceive to be the main point, in a general
200	00:14:09.370	00:14:12.550	sense, and that is, they feel they need labor stability,
201	00:14:12.560	00:14:15.570	they need an end to the walkouts--wildcats--they need
202	00:14:15.580	00:14:21.060	a reduction of absenteeism, they want the union to give
203	00:14:21.070	00:14:25.020	what it bargained for in 1974, and that is a
204	00:14:25.030	00:14:27.370	labor force that is on the job when it should
205	00:14:27.380	00:14:30.650	be on the job. So they're unified in the general
206	00:14:30.660	00:14:33.510	sense, but I think on how you go about achieving
207	00:14:33.520	00:14:37.360	that in the contract there is some disunity. Now, whether
208	00:14:37.370	00:14:44.260	that will result in a major loss of bargaining leverage
209	00:14:44.270	00:14:46.940	is unclear at this point. Well, we just heard what
210	00:14:46.950	00:14:51.990	Tom Bethell laid out, the union position on a "responsible"
211	00:14:52.000	00:14:55.640	right to strike over local grievances. What's management's position on
212	00:14:55.650	00:14:59.140	that? They don't want that under any circumstances, do they?
213	00:14:59.150	00:15:02.790	That's right, Jim. Absolutely, that seems to be one of
214	00:15:02.800	00:15:08.030	the specific things they are unanimous about: no right to
215	00:15:08.040	00:15:12.430	strike in the contract. In reply to the statement, well,
216	00:15:12.440	00:15:15.670	if it's a limited right and if it's done with
217	00:15:15.680	00:15:20.040	qualifications and so forth, why not then? Industry's response is,
218	00:15:20.050	00:15:23.200	if the United Mine Workers were, for instance, like the
219	00:15:23.210	00:15:26.140	United Auto Workers, which does have a right to strike
220	00:15:26.150	00:15:29.250	on a limited basis in the auto industry over certain
221	00:15:29.260	00:15:32.070	kinds of issues but it has a lot of political
222	00:15:32.080	00:15:35.370	discipline--if the United Mine Workers were that kind of
223	00:15:35.380	00:15:39.220	union, it might not be so bad. But the industry
224	00:15:39.230	00:15:44.210	worries that with the long tradition of honoring anybody who
225	00:15:44.220	00:15:46.660	goes out and pickets a mine, even though the local
226	00:15:46.670	00:15:50.060	votes not to strike, suppose a guy goes out and
227	00:15:50.070	00:15:52.810	pickets the mine anyway and the fellows refuse to cross
228	00:15:52.820	00:15:56.240	the line. That's industry's worry. That's exactly, of course, what's
229	00:15:56.250	00:15:58.930	happening with the closing of the non-union mines now, is
230	00:15:58.940	00:16:01.870	it not? I mean, there are people who are not
231	00:16:01.880	00:16:04.040	members of this union who are honoring picket lines and
232	00:16:04.050	00:16:07.540	closing down the other mines. Oh, sure. This generally happens
233	00:16:07.550	00:16:10.970	in a strike time, especially in the non-union mines that
234	00:16:10.980	00:16:16.180	are adjacent, in Appalachia, to the union mines. These people
235	00:16:16.190	00:16:23.420	live close together, and it's a bowl of ferment. Let
236	00:16:23.430	00:16:26.300	me ask you both, back to you also, Mr. Bethell,
237	00:16:26.310	00:16:27.300	and then I want to bring you in too in
238	00:16:27.310	00:16:30.680	a moment, Mr. Jones: how is this thing likely to
239	00:16:30.690	00:16:36.950	be resolved? Let's take this issue of single mine strikes.
240	00:16:36.960	00:16:38.960	It seems to me from what both of you have
241	00:16:38.970	00:16:42.500	said that there's not a whole lot of room for
242	00:16:42.510	00:16:48.240	give there. Where's the resolution going to come? Well, I'm
243	00:16:48.250	00:16:50.600	not sure that I can predict where it's going to
244	00:16:50.610	00:16:53.190	come. I think...Where is there room for give, let's
245	00:16:53.200	00:16:54.420	put it that way. I think that both sides to
246	00:16:54.430	00:16:56.970	a remarkable degree are locked in where they are now,
247	00:16:56.980	00:16:59.340	much more than you would expect at this point in
248	00:16:59.350	00:17:03.590	time. Obviously the nature of negotiations is to give on
249	00:17:03.600	00:17:11.600	both sides. The union probably could modify its position on
250	00:17:11.610	00:17:14.670	the right to strike if it were fairly sure that
251	00:17:14.680	00:17:17.020	no punitive clauses were going to wind up in the
252	00:17:17.030	00:17:24.780	contract penalizing those who strike or those who are absent
253	00:17:24.790	00:17:27.160	without an excuse, which I think actually is probably more
254	00:17:27.170	00:17:29.880	of an issue to the industry than the wildcats themselves;
255	00:17:29.890	00:17:31.720	it's really the question of whether you can count on
256	00:17:31.730	00:17:35.900	somebody being at the mine every day. But it's not
257	00:17:35.910	00:17:37.430	clear at all that they're going to be able to
258	00:17:37.440	00:17:39.690	get that kind of an agreement. Let me ask you,
259	00:17:39.700	00:17:46.010	Mr. Jones, speaking for you and your local and your
260	00:17:46.020	00:17:49.240	view of this particular issue, are you willing to give
261	00:17:49.250	00:17:52.380	on this? Do you see any room in there for
262	00:17:52.390	00:17:55.630	negotiation, or are you adamant? Well, first of all, I
263	00:17:55.640	00:17:58.480	don't think we've touched on in the whole thing about
264	00:17:58.490	00:18:01.660	what a right to strike is, in limited form. What
265	00:18:01.670	00:18:04.370	we're talking about is what Tom got on there a
266	00:18:04.380	00:18:10.170	little bit about making a quicker way of handling grievances.
267	00:18:10.180	00:18:12.680	Now, the way I see a limited right to strike
268	00:18:12.690	00:18:16.060	to be would be, say we've got a problem at
269	00:18:16.070	00:18:18.470	the mine site. We go in and talk to management.
270	00:18:18.480	00:18:21.870	Management says, "Well, you know, let's slide it up, we'll
271	00:18:21.880	00:18:25.020	just arbitrate it." This is the way it happens now.
272	00:18:25.030	00:18:28.530	We go into an arbitrator, who actually doesn't know what
273	00:18:28.540	00:18:32.100	goes on in a coal mine. And to give you
274	00:18:32.110	00:18:37.140	a good example, the company is able to go hire
275	00:18:37.150	00:18:40.680	qualified and very competent people to write these grievances for
276	00:18:40.690	00:18:46.240	them. They're wrote up as a legal document. At the
277	00:18:46.250	00:18:51.030	company I work for, the personnel man had a degree
278	00:18:51.040	00:18:54.200	in psychology plus a degree in law. Now, how am
279	00:18:54.210	00:18:56.610	I, with a high school education, going to write a
280	00:18:56.620	00:19:00.900	grievance that would do justice to my fellow worker when
281	00:19:00.910	00:19:03.310	I have to go against something like this? So if
282	00:19:03.320	00:19:06.990	we had a limited right to strike, then the company
283	00:19:07.000	00:19:10.590	would say, "Okay, if we don't handle this problem and
284	00:19:10.600	00:19:15.640	try to make a sincere effort to settle this thing,
285	00:19:15.650	00:19:17.440	the mine is going to go on strike." See, I
286	00:19:17.450	00:19:21.480	can go back to my people and say, "Okay, if
287	00:19:21.490	00:19:24.040	a majority vote, then we're going to walk, we're going
288	00:19:24.050	00:19:26.150	to come out." In other words, your answer is, you
289	00:19:26.160	00:19:28.130	want the limited right to strike and if it's not
290	00:19:28.140	00:19:30.340	in that contract your people aren't going to support it,
291	00:19:30.350	00:19:36.090	is that right? I would say so, yes. But what
292	00:19:36.100	00:19:37.920	I'm trying to say is that the whole picture is
293	00:19:37.930	00:19:39.580	not just the idea that we're going to be out
294	00:19:39.590	00:19:42.160	here stopping coal mines, stopping mines from working; this is
295	00:19:42.170	00:19:46.100	what's happened now. And I think there would be less
296	00:19:46.110	00:19:50.640	strikes, less problems. Of course, Mr. Hoerr, that's not the
297	00:19:50.650	00:19:54.410	way management sees it at all. Is there any give
298	00:19:54.420	00:19:57.330	in their position? They're not going to handle even a
299	00:19:57.340	00:20:00.210	limited strike--they're not going to accept that, are they?
300	00:20:00.220	00:20:03.630	They say that they would take a strike over that,
301	00:20:03.640	00:20:06.290	which they are doing right now. You know, they have
302	00:20:06.300	00:20:09.810	made other proposals to in effect penalize--although they call
303	00:20:09.820	00:20:13.440	it "reward" workers for being at work all the time.
304	00:20:13.450	00:20:16.000	But it's very difficult not to call it a penalty,
305	00:20:16.010	00:20:18.890	because what it amounts to is in any biweekly pay
306	00:20:18.900	00:20:22.170	period if a person is absent because of a strike,
307	00:20:22.180	00:20:23.720	the rest of the time he is at work he
308	00:20:23.730	00:20:27.290	only gets sixty percent of his regular wages. And if
309	00:20:27.300	00:20:30.910	he's absent for any other kind of unexcused reason, he
310	00:20:30.920	00:20:34.040	gets only seventy percent of his wages. And yet a
311	00:20:34.050	00:20:37.150	further kind of penalty is a striker would have to
312	00:20:37.160	00:20:40.640	pay back into the health and welfare funds a total
313	00:20:40.650	00:20:44.780	of twenty-two dollars a day, that being his assessment. Let
314	00:20:44.790	00:20:47.230	me ask you, then, John, you're as familiar with the
315	00:20:47.240	00:20:49.890	labor side of this as you are with the management
316	00:20:49.900	00:20:52.750	side; where do you see the give? I think Tom
317	00:20:52.760	00:20:56.600	Bethell pointed out an obvious place for tradeoff. Now, whether
318	00:20:56.610	00:20:58.960	that will happen or not I don't know. Neither one
319	00:20:58.970	00:21:03.340	of us is sitting at the bargaining table. That is,
320	00:21:03.350	00:21:06.740	if management is willing to move off this business of
321	00:21:06.750	00:21:09.660	penalizing people--and I think a lot of union people
322	00:21:09.670	00:21:12.340	are really very disturbed about that; I've talked to rank
323	00:21:12.350	00:21:15.290	and file miners who feel that why should the management
324	00:21:15.300	00:21:18.000	have the ability to penalize if we don't have the
325	00:21:18.010	00:21:21.250	ability to penalize them for violating the contract? Meaning, the
326	00:21:21.260	00:21:25.500	right to strike. That's right--well, no, but why should
327	00:21:25.510	00:21:27.480	one side have the ability to penalize if the other
328	00:21:27.490	00:21:29.640	side doesn't? And I think if this is put out
329	00:21:29.650	00:21:32.500	for ratification, for instance, a lot of miners will take
330	00:21:32.510	00:21:36.460	this very common sense point of view. And union officials
331	00:21:36.470	00:21:39.870	I talk to are very worried about getting ratification of
332	00:21:39.880	00:21:42.520	any contract that has this kind of provision in it.
333	00:21:42.530	00:21:45.980	So the question is, can the union move off the
334	00:21:45.990	00:21:48.850	right to strike; can industry move away from this penalty
335	00:21:48.860	00:21:54.180	system? All right. Robin? Yes. Mr. Jones, your union leader,
336	00:21:54.190	00:21:57.930	Arnold Miller, said today that the strike might last three
337	00:21:57.940	00:22:00.990	to four months. Could your members hold out anything like
338	00:22:01.000	00:22:03.750	that long? Let's tick off the things: you have no
339	00:22:03.760	00:22:05.760	strike pay, right? No. In the union. There's no strike
340	00:22:05.770	00:22:09.810	fund. In many states and, I believe, yours in Illinois,
341	00:22:09.820	00:22:12.590	you do not normally qualify for unemployment insurance if you're
342	00:22:12.600	00:22:15.800	on strike. That's correct. Your health benefits have stopped with
343	00:22:15.810	00:22:18.330	the strike. Yes. How are your guys going to hold
344	00:22:18.340	00:22:24.560	out? Well, I would say that most of the people,
345	00:22:24.570	00:22:27.010	with the exception of maybe the very young miners who've
346	00:22:27.020	00:22:30.590	just started, have known for quite some time that we
347	00:22:30.600	00:22:33.310	were going to have a strike this time because we
348	00:22:33.320	00:22:35.430	could see from the way things were going, just like
349	00:22:35.440	00:22:40.130	Tom Bethell pointed out, that we were headed directly into
350	00:22:40.140	00:22:43.140	a strike. So therefore we have prepared ourselves to a
351	00:22:43.150	00:22:44.820	certain extent. Of course, it takes a lot of money
352	00:22:44.830	00:22:46.530	to keep...You mean you've been saving? Sure; we've been
353	00:22:46.540	00:22:50.750	saving money. A miner's basic pay now is about sixty
354	00:22:50.760	00:22:53.120	dollars a day, right? That is the official basic pay.
355	00:22:53.130	00:22:55.480	Yes, it's about average. What can a miner make who's
356	00:22:55.490	00:23:01.230	sort of working full-time, in a week now? Basically, in
357	00:23:01.240	00:23:07.060	a week--I'm using my mine for an example--we
358	00:23:07.070	00:23:09.390	produce coal five days a week, and then we work
359	00:23:09.400	00:23:13.440	the idle day on Saturday, which doesn't mean everyone works;
360	00:23:13.450	00:23:14.820	I'll say about seventy-five percent of people work...What's the
361	00:23:14.830	00:23:16.920	average take-home pay, would you say? Okay, I would say
362	00:23:16.930	00:23:22.080	that would be, before check-off, somewhere around three hundred seventy-five
363	00:23:22.090	00:23:24.840	to eighty dollars. I see. So they've been able to
364	00:23:24.850	00:23:26.560	save out of that. So you think they'll be able
365	00:23:26.570	00:23:29.680	to hold out for some time. Your own members, would
366	00:23:29.690	00:23:30.780	they be able to hold out? I think it'd put
367	00:23:30.790	00:23:33.040	a hardship. Don't get me wrong, I think that we'll
368	00:23:33.050	00:23:37.590	have to adjust our way of living. But if it
369	00:23:37.600	00:23:40.230	comes down to a heads-up battle, which it looks like
370	00:23:40.240	00:23:43.230	it's going to--and to me there's no reason for
371	00:23:43.240	00:23:47.380	this--I think that we'll stay behind Arnold. Jerry, you
372	00:23:47.390	00:23:52.540	were shaking your head a while ago when in Washington
373	00:23:52.550	00:23:55.370	Tom Bethell was talking about the amount of coal that
374	00:23:55.380	00:23:58.860	industry has stockpiled. Do you not believe that it's stockpiled
375	00:23:58.870	00:24:01.680	as much as it says it has? No, sir, Robin,
376	00:24:01.690	00:24:04.290	I don't really believe this, because all their figures that
377	00:24:04.300	00:24:06.490	the BCOA has put out and the company has put
378	00:24:06.500	00:24:09.180	out, they say production's down this year, we're not producing
379	00:24:09.190	00:24:13.530	coal; so therefore, where are they getting this coal? Of
380	00:24:13.540	00:24:16.130	course, I realize that there's been some increase in production
381	00:24:16.140	00:24:18.320	in the West, but this is a different quality of
382	00:24:18.330	00:24:19.700	coal than what we have here. You've got to have
383	00:24:19.710	00:24:22.280	the coal from Illinois, the coal from West Virginia and
384	00:24:22.290	00:24:24.670	the areas out here to mix with this coal to
385	00:24:24.680	00:24:28.330	have the amount of BTU`s. Tom Bethell, how accurate are
386	00:24:28.340	00:24:31.060	the figures on the coal stockpiles? Are you satisfied with
387	00:24:31.070	00:24:35.220	them yourself? That was John Hoerr who gave those projections...
388	00:24:35.230	00:24:36.390	I beg your pardon. But I would have to agree
389	00:24:36.400	00:24:39.840	with him. I do think, though, that there is a
390	00:24:39.850	00:24:46.990	tendency to exaggerate the amount of time that a strike
391	00:24:47.000	00:24:49.950	will go on without impact on the basis of saying
392	00:24:49.960	00:24:52.270	there's ninety days of coal on the ground. If the
393	00:24:52.280	00:24:55.340	utility gets down below, say, a thirty-day supply, it goes
394	00:24:55.350	00:24:57.750	into a state of cardiac arrest about what it's going
395	00:24:57.760	00:25:01.720	to do. So when will the crunch begin to be
396	00:25:01.730	00:25:05.830	felt, and in which parts of industry first--either of
397	00:25:05.840	00:25:08.560	you; Mr. Hoerr, do you have a view on that?
398	00:25:08.570	00:25:10.690	You know, the steel industry is very depressed on a
399	00:25:10.700	00:25:13.370	worldwide basis, and one of the strange anomalies was that
400	00:25:13.380	00:25:16.850	as late as last week before the strike started, the
401	00:25:16.860	00:25:19.740	high-quality metallurgical mines in southern West Virginia were on two
402	00:25:19.750	00:25:23.010	and three-day weeks, even before the strike started. So it
403	00:25:23.020	00:25:25.770	shows right there that the steel mills don't really need
404	00:25:25.780	00:25:29.490	very much coal, even on a worldwide basis. And so
405	00:25:29.500	00:25:32.310	I don't know, I would suppose that the utilities, given
406	00:25:32.320	00:25:34.990	Tom's cardiac arrest principle, would be the first to feel
407	00:25:35.000	00:25:40.170	it. What about private users of coal? Are there still
408	00:25:40.180	00:25:44.500	many schools and buildings and things heated by coal that
409	00:25:44.510	00:25:46.360	would begin to feel it sooner who mightn't have been
410	00:25:46.370	00:25:51.360	able to stockpile enough? Tom? I think the answer to
411	00:25:51.370	00:25:55.860	that really is no, in terms of a statistically significant
412	00:25:55.870	00:25:58.590	amount of coal. You only have about eight percent of
413	00:25:58.600	00:26:01.730	current production going into that particular market. I see. In
414	00:26:01.740	00:26:06.340	other words, Tom, have those people been right who over
415	00:26:06.350	00:26:09.960	the last month have been in effect discounting this strike
416	00:26:09.970	00:26:13.210	because unlike the days when John L. Lewis could practically
417	00:26:13.220	00:26:15.710	bring the country to a halt with a nationwide coal
418	00:26:15.720	00:26:19.200	strike, it is not going to have that effect immediately?
419	00:26:19.210	00:26:21.610	I would say that they are only partially right and
420	00:26:21.620	00:26:25.850	that that is not entirely true in the sense that
421	00:26:25.860	00:26:29.460	the major mines in the country, the major deep mines,
422	00:26:29.470	00:26:34.610	all the metallurgical mines are UMW mines. They will continue
423	00:26:34.620	00:26:37.850	to be UMW mines into the foreseeable future. And they
424	00:26:37.860	00:26:40.560	determine the pattern of production in the country even though
425	00:26:40.570	00:26:42.710	it's true that you have a lot more production now
426	00:26:42.720	00:26:45.600	coming out of the West from nonunion surface mines. But
427	00:26:45.610	00:26:48.760	it's absolutely true what Jerry said about the differences in
428	00:26:48.770	00:26:50.710	the quality of the production coming out of the West
429	00:26:50.720	00:26:55.700	and those other variables. Even though the UMW accounts today
430	00:26:55.710	00:26:58.900	for only about sixty percent, incidentally, not fifty percent...Thank
431	00:26:58.910	00:27:02.950	you....of production, that sixty percent is critical to the
432	00:27:02.960	00:27:06.340	country. In Jerry's area, for example, if you're just talking
433	00:27:06.350	00:27:10.300	Illinois, they control more than ninety-five percent of the production.
434	00:27:10.310	00:27:13.210	So anybody who's talking about consuming Illinois coal is talking
435	00:27:13.220	00:27:17.570	about consuming UMW coal. In West Virginia, which is where
436	00:27:17.580	00:27:20.390	your real heavy trouble spot is and has been for
437	00:27:20.400	00:27:24.180	the past three years, that's about ninety percent UMW. So
438	00:27:24.190	00:27:28.010	when you segregate by market or you segregate by type
439	00:27:28.020	00:27:31.550	of consumption or type of production, the UMW is still
440	00:27:31.560	00:27:34.980	basically the only game in town, and the operators, if
441	00:27:34.990	00:27:37.640	they attempt to ignore that fact, I think are buying
442	00:27:37.650	00:27:40.630	themselves three, five, or whatever many more years of terrible
443	00:27:40.640	00:27:43.470	labor relations with some major consequences for the country as
444	00:27:43.480	00:27:46.490	a whole. So Mr. Hoerr, is all this discounting of
445	00:27:46.500	00:27:50.490	the effects of the strike a bit of psychological warfare?
446	00:27:50.500	00:27:53.130	To some extent, sure; that always goes on. I think
447	00:27:53.140	00:27:59.220	Tom is right that the operators would be unwise to
448	00:27:59.230	00:28:01.350	rely on that. But I would like to point out
449	00:28:01.360	00:28:03.630	that you brought up the subject of John L. Lewis
450	00:28:03.640	00:28:06.600	and how he seemed to have what commentators used to
451	00:28:06.610	00:28:09.960	call a "stranglehold" on the country. Back in the forties,
452	00:28:09.970	00:28:13.100	I believe some eighty percent of all production was controlled
453	00:28:13.110	00:28:16.270	by coal; indeed, in 1933, if you would believe it,
454	00:28:16.280	00:28:21.640	ninety percent of production was controlled by the UMW. And
455	00:28:21.650	00:28:25.310	Tom makes some valid points about the segmented markets, but
456	00:28:25.320	00:28:30.420	even in Appalachia today--in Ohio and Pennsylvania, for instance--
457	00:28:30.430	00:28:34.280	less than sixty percent of the coal produced is UMW
458	00:28:34.290	00:28:37.230	coal. And that's a rather startling figure when you think
459	00:28:37.240	00:28:42.670	about what you normally think of as traditional UMW strongholds.
460	00:28:42.680	00:28:46.820	Do you fear, Mr. Jones, finally, that this strike may
461	00:28:46.830	00:28:49.460	actually have an effect of weakening your union over the
462	00:28:49.470	00:28:52.640	long run? Are you worried about that? Actually, I'm not
463	00:28:52.650	00:28:55.870	worried about that point. I don't believe that it's going
464	00:28:55.880	00:28:57.710	to weaken the union. I think that actually if you
465	00:28:57.720	00:29:01.620	want to break it down that the BCOA, the operators,
466	00:29:01.630	00:29:04.370	are having more problems than we are internally. Every day
467	00:29:04.380	00:29:07.490	there's some companies that's talking of dropping out, wanting to
468	00:29:07.500	00:29:10.680	negotiate separate contracts. Now, that's not good from our standpoint
469	00:29:10.690	00:29:12.720	as far as we've got to spread out and we're
470	00:29:12.730	00:29:14.850	going to have to be working under more than one
471	00:29:14.860	00:29:17.670	nationwide agreement. We'd rather be under all one agreement. But
472	00:29:17.680	00:29:20.890	this points to the fact that the BCOA does have
473	00:29:20.900	00:29:23.090	problems, too, internally. Thank you. We have to leave it
474	00:29:23.100	00:29:25.930	there. Thank you both very much in Washington. Thank you,
475	00:29:25.940	00:29:29.300	Mr. Jones. Good night, Jim. That's all for tonight. I'll
476	00:29:29.310	00:29:31.700	be away for a few days starting tomorrow, and sitting
477	00:29:31.710	00:29:34.480	in for me here will be Charlayne Hunter-Gault, who joined
478	00:29:34.490	00:31:04.451	The MacNeil/Lehrer Report this week. Thank you. Good night.
