1	00:01:04.610	00:01:07.340	Good evening, I'm Margaret Warner. Jim Lehrer is off this
2	00:01:07.350	00:01:11.270	week. On the NewsHour tonight, we'll look at President-elect Bush's
3	00:01:11.280	00:01:14.980	choice for secretary of defense, Paul Solman reports on a
4	00:01:14.990	00:01:17.650	new breed of philanthropists who are changing the rules of
5	00:01:17.660	00:01:20.710	the game, Susan Dentzer offers an update on the risks
6	00:01:20.720	00:01:25.280	of cellular telephones, and Elizabeth Farnsworth gets some historical perspective
7	00:01:25.290	00:01:29.340	on the year 2000 from Michael Beschloss, Haynes Johnson, Richard
8	00:01:29.350	00:01:32.900	Norton Smith and Roger Wilkins. It all follows our summary
9	00:01:32.910	00:02:20.590	of the news this Thursday. President-elect Bush announced his nominee
10	00:02:20.600	00:02:24.250	for defense secretary today. He's Donald Rumsfeld, a former White
11	00:02:24.260	00:02:27.130	House chief of staff who was defense secretary under President
12	00:02:27.140	00:02:30.020	Ford. We'll have more on the Rumsfeld pick right after
13	00:02:30.030	00:02:33.470	the News Summary. The first data from the year 2000
14	00:02:33.480	00:02:36.990	Census, released today, show the U.S. population has jumped more
15	00:02:37.000	00:02:42.530	than 13% since 1990 to more than 281 million people.
16	00:02:42.540	00:02:44.710	The growth has come unevenly--and that will cause a
17	00:02:44.720	00:02:48.230	reallocation in the U.S. House of Representatives. Among the biggest
18	00:02:48.240	00:02:52.620	changes, Arizona, Texas, Georgia and Florida will gain two seats
19	00:02:52.630	00:02:56.620	each, while New York and Pennsylvania will each lose two.
20	00:02:56.630	00:02:59.550	All told, 18 of the 50 states will either gain
21	00:02:59.560	00:03:04.040	or lose representatives. President Clinton raised the federal budget surplus
22	00:03:04.050	00:03:08.800	projection today--to $1.9 trillion over the next decade. That's
23	00:03:08.810	00:03:13.250	$300 billion more than the previous estimate, issued last summer.
24	00:03:13.260	00:03:16.350	The President said the new figures mean the entire $5.6
25	00:03:16.360	00:03:19.780	trillion national debt could be paid off in nine years,
26	00:03:19.790	00:03:22.590	if all of the surplus is used for that purpose.
27	00:03:22.600	00:03:26.230	He spoke at the White House. I have often said
28	00:03:26.240	00:03:28.350	that I believe we should use a portion of the
29	00:03:28.360	00:03:32.630	surplus to make critical investments in education, provide a prescription
30	00:03:32.640	00:03:36.120	drug benefit through Medicare to our seniors and have a
31	00:03:36.130	00:03:40.560	targeted tax cut. If the incoming administration and the new
32	00:03:40.570	00:03:47.320	Congress make such decisions, they could still get us out
33	00:03:47.330	00:03:51.380	of debt early. President-elect Bush has proposed a much bigger
34	00:03:51.390	00:03:55.590	tax cut than Mr. Clinton advocates, some $1.3 trillion over
35	00:03:55.600	00:03:58.980	ten years. Also today, the President said he has decided
36	00:03:58.990	00:04:01.980	not to visit North Korea before leaving office next month.
37	00:04:01.990	00:04:04.320	He said there wasn't enough time to prepare the deal
38	00:04:04.330	00:04:07.540	he sought, under which Pyongyang would agree to stop producing
39	00:04:07.550	00:04:11.470	ballistic missiles. In the Middle East today, a bomb exploded
40	00:04:11.480	00:04:14.650	on a bus in Tel Aviv, injuring 14 people. And
41	00:04:14.660	00:04:17.760	two Israelis were killed in an attack in Gaza. We
42	00:04:17.770	00:04:25.060	have a report from John Irvine of Independent Television News.
43	00:04:25.070	00:04:29.070	Some of the victims of today's upsurge in violence: Israeli
44	00:04:29.080	00:04:32.440	soldiers injured in an ambush that killed two of their
45	00:04:32.450	00:04:37.390	colleagues on the Gaza strip. Earlier, there were bomb explosions
46	00:04:37.400	00:04:39.590	on a bus, as it traveled along one of the
47	00:04:39.600	00:04:44.110	busiest roads in Tel Aviv. Both attacks were probably the
48	00:04:44.120	00:04:48.590	work of Palestinian militants opposed to the peace process, and
49	00:04:48.600	00:04:51.280	the violence was another setback on a day that had
50	00:04:51.290	00:04:55.110	already seen the cancellation of a summit, between the Israeli
51	00:04:55.120	00:05:00.520	and Palestinian leaders. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, pulled
52	00:05:00.530	00:05:04.150	out of that meeting, deciding it was pointless since the
53	00:05:04.160	00:05:09.260	Palestinians had not given a clear-cut response to American proposals,
54	00:05:09.270	00:05:13.460	meant to be the basis for moving forward. Yasser Arafat,
55	00:05:13.470	00:05:17.270	who's been with the Egyptian President today, says the blueprint
56	00:05:17.280	00:05:21.110	for peace is not detailed enough, and he wants clarification
57	00:05:21.120	00:05:26.720	before accepting or rejecting it outright. President Clinton condemned the
58	00:05:26.730	00:05:29.240	attacks and said they showed the prospects for peace will
59	00:05:29.250	00:05:32.300	not improve with time. He said he's still pursuing an
60	00:05:32.310	00:05:35.060	agreement, but added "There is no point in our talking
61	00:05:35.070	00:05:38.110	further unless both sides accept the parameters I have laid
62	00:05:38.120	00:05:41.940	out." Montgomery Ward said today it was closing its doors
63	00:05:41.950	00:05:43.660	and filing for bankruptcy, after more than a century in
64	00:05:43.670	00:05:46.760	the retailing business. Founded in 1872, the Chicago-based chain grew
65	00:05:46.770	00:05:50.630	to more than 250 stores in 31 states and employed
66	00:05:50.640	00:05:54.720	37,000 people. The company said weak holiday sales made the
67	00:05:54.730	00:05:58.820	decision unavoidable. Montgomery Ward is a subsidiary of General Electric
68	00:05:58.830	00:06:03.570	Company. Record cold and snow continued across the South, Southwest
69	00:06:03.580	00:06:07.420	and Midwest today. 37 deaths are blamed on the storms,
70	00:06:07.430	00:06:11.300	including 22 on Texas highways. Hundreds of thousands of people
71	00:06:11.310	00:06:15.560	remain without power, and more storms are forecast. In Texas,
72	00:06:15.570	00:06:18.710	police and National Guard troops had to rescue about 1,000
73	00:06:18.720	00:06:22.030	motorists stranded overnight by ice and snow on a highway
74	00:06:22.040	00:06:25.710	near Abilene. That's it for the News Summary tonight. Now
75	00:06:25.720	00:06:29.470	it's on to another Bush cabinet choice, giving away money
76	00:06:29.480	00:06:33.630	with a purpose, an update on cellular telephones, and historical
77	00:06:33.640	00:06:44.670	perspectives on the year 2000. A new boss for the
78	00:06:44.680	00:06:48.970	Pentagon. We start with a report from Spencer Michels. Donald
79	00:06:48.980	00:06:53.970	Rumsfeld's appointment as Secretary of Defense is a unprecedented return
80	00:06:53.980	00:06:57.290	engagement. It brings back to government--at the age of
81	00:06:57.300	00:07:01.090	68--a man who began serving in elective and appointed
82	00:07:01.100	00:07:06.180	office in 1963, following a stint as a Navy pilot.
83	00:07:06.190	00:07:08.720	Rumsfeld was elected to the first of four terms in
84	00:07:08.730	00:07:12.180	congress, at the age of 30. Under President Nixon, he
85	00:07:12.190	00:07:16.850	held several jobs, including ambassador to NATO. When Gerald Ford
86	00:07:16.860	00:07:21.980	became President, Rumsfeld became chief of staff, and in 1975
87	00:07:21.990	00:07:25.230	he assumed the job of defense secretary--the youngest in
88	00:07:25.240	00:07:29.260	history. Since leaving government, he worked as a business executive,
89	00:07:29.270	00:07:34.030	most recently as chairman and CEO of General Instrument Corporation,
90	00:07:34.040	00:07:39.000	a television technology firm. In announcing Rumsfeld's appointment, Mr. Bush
91	00:07:39.010	00:07:42.460	outlined his own goals for the nation's defense. One is
92	00:07:42.470	00:07:46.270	to strengthen the bond of trust between the American President
93	00:07:46.280	00:07:51.660	and those who wear our nation's uniform. Secondly is defend
94	00:07:51.670	00:07:57.060	our people and allies against missiles and terror. And thirdly
95	00:07:57.070	00:07:59.670	is to begin creating a military prepared for the dangers
96	00:07:59.680	00:08:03.490	of a new century. We hope to never send our
97	00:08:03.500	00:08:08.300	troops into combat, but if deterrence were to fail, we
98	00:08:08.310	00:08:12.090	must send them fully prepared and equipped for the dangers
99	00:08:12.100	00:08:16.970	that they will face. Secondly, to defend our forces and
100	00:08:16.980	00:08:19.910	allies and our own country from the threat of missile
101	00:08:19.920	00:08:24.700	attack or accidental launch, we must develop a missile defense
102	00:08:24.710	00:08:29.160	system. I was most impressed by the chairman of the
103	00:08:29.170	00:08:35.180	national commission's ballistic missile threats work. That chairman was Don
104	00:08:35.190	00:08:40.180	Rumsfeld. I felt he did an extraordinary job with a
105	00:08:40.190	00:08:47.760	delicate assignment. He brought people together to understand the realities
106	00:08:47.770	00:08:53.540	of the modern world. Our nation is positioned well to
107	00:08:53.550	00:09:01.210	use technologies to redefine the military. And so, one of
108	00:09:01.220	00:09:06.040	Secretary Rumsfeld's first tasks will be to challenge the status
109	00:09:06.050	00:09:11.820	quo inside the Pentagon, to develop a strategy necessary to
110	00:09:11.830	00:09:16.700	have a force equipped for warfare of the 21st century.
111	00:09:16.710	00:09:20.410	Rumsfeld endorsed that blueprint for defense. It is clearly not
112	00:09:20.420	00:09:26.780	a time at the Pentagon for presiding or calibrating modestly.
113	00:09:26.790	00:09:30.650	Rather, we are in a new national security environment. We
114	00:09:30.660	00:09:33.370	do need to be arranged to deal with the new
115	00:09:33.380	00:09:37.220	threats, not the old ones, as you point out, with
116	00:09:37.230	00:09:42.950	information warfare, missile defense, terrorism, defense of our space assets
117	00:09:42.960	00:09:46.030	and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction throughout the
118	00:09:46.040	00:09:52.540	world. History teaches us that weakness is provocative. The task
119	00:09:52.550	00:09:57.050	you have outlined is to fashion deterrence and defense capabilities,
120	00:09:57.060	00:10:00.440	so that our country will be able to successfully contribute
121	00:10:00.450	00:10:03.180	to peace and stability in the world. Mr. Rumsfeld was
122	00:10:03.190	00:10:05.680	asked how seriously he took the threat of a missile
123	00:10:05.690	00:10:09.830	attack. There's no question but that the proliferation of weapons
124	00:10:09.840	00:10:13.580	of mass destruction and the delivery systems for them is
125	00:10:13.590	00:10:16.480	extensive across the world. There is no question but that
126	00:10:16.490	00:10:21.980	a number of nations are supplying other nations with elements
127	00:10:21.990	00:10:26.140	that they need and assisting them in bypassing the normal
128	00:10:26.150	00:10:29.580	period of years it would take to develop these capabilities.
129	00:10:29.590	00:10:33.670	And I consider that, myself, to be a real threat.
130	00:10:33.680	00:10:36.570	The President elect was asked what priority, in his first
131	00:10:36.580	00:10:40.670	100 days, he would give rebuilding the military. Well, first,
132	00:10:40.680	00:10:42.310	in my budget, I can assure you, there's going to
133	00:10:42.320	00:10:45.400	be a military pay raise greater than the pay raise,
134	00:10:45.410	00:10:48.960	which was enacted a year ago. And secondly, I've always
135	00:10:48.970	00:10:54.890	believed that we're going to have a selling job to
136	00:10:54.900	00:10:59.910	do on Congress as to how to modernize the military.
137	00:10:59.920	00:11:04.040	And that requires, first and foremost, a top-to-bottom--a bottom-to-top
138	00:11:04.050	00:11:07.100	review of what exists today and what the military ought
139	00:11:07.110	00:11:09.390	to look like tomorrow. And that's going to be one
140	00:11:09.400	00:11:13.660	of Don Rumsfeld's first jobs. Mr. Bush was also asked
141	00:11:13.670	00:11:17.220	if, in addition to Mr. Rumsfeld, Colin Powell and Vice
142	00:11:17.230	00:11:20.950	President-elect Cheney would have influence over the Pentagon. One of
143	00:11:20.960	00:11:23.840	the things that's really important for the American people to
144	00:11:23.850	00:11:25.980	understand is, I'll be getting some of the best counsel
145	00:11:25.990	00:11:30.760	possible. And so, you bet, General Powell's a strong figure
146	00:11:30.770	00:11:35.820	and Dick Cheney's no shrinking violet, but neither is Don
147	00:11:35.830	00:11:44.180	Rumsfeld, nor Condi Rice. I view the four as being
148	00:11:44.190	00:11:47.250	able to complement each other. There's going to be disagreements.
149	00:11:47.260	00:11:51.370	I hope there is disagreement, because I know that disagreement
150	00:11:51.380	00:11:56.850	will be based upon solid thought. And what you need
151	00:11:56.860	00:12:00.180	to know is that if there is disagreement, I'll be
152	00:12:00.190	00:12:03.080	prepared to make the decision necessary for the good of
153	00:12:03.090	00:12:07.380	the country. President-elect Bush has several more cabinet nominations to
154	00:12:07.390	00:12:10.690	make--a process he says he hopes he can finish
155	00:12:10.700	00:12:14.250	by the first week in January. For more on the
156	00:12:14.260	00:12:17.970	Rumsfeld choice, we go to: James Woolsey, a former CIA
157	00:12:17.980	00:12:21.300	director and navy undersecretary who served on the missile defense
158	00:12:21.310	00:12:25.700	commission chaired by Rumsfeld; retired General George Joulwan, who was
159	00:12:25.710	00:12:28.700	supreme allied commander of NATO when NATO sent troops into
160	00:12:28.710	00:12:32.090	Bosnia; and John Isaacs, president of the Council for a
161	00:12:32.100	00:12:37.170	Livable World, an arms control advocacy group. Welcome, gentlemen, and
162	00:12:37.180	00:12:39.110	General, what do you make of this choice? I think
163	00:12:39.120	00:12:42.600	it's an excellent choice. I have watched Don Rumsfeld for
164	00:12:42.610	00:12:46.780	many years. He brings great experience, not only in the
165	00:12:46.790	00:12:50.020	business world, but in his experience in NATO and the
166	00:12:50.030	00:12:53.720	Middle East. And I believe he's going to provide management
167	00:12:53.730	00:12:58.010	and leadership to the Pentagon and developing this strategy he
168	00:12:58.020	00:13:00.680	talks about, which I think is absolutely necessary, with the
169	00:13:00.690	00:13:04.910	President and the national security team. I believe Don Rumsfeld
170	00:13:04.920	00:13:07.460	was going to be a key element of that team.
171	00:13:07.470	00:13:10.820	What does the choice tell but Bush's priorities that maybe
172	00:13:10.830	00:13:14.290	we didn't know before? Well, I think he's putting a
173	00:13:14.300	00:13:18.460	very strong priority on the defense and the military. And
174	00:13:18.470	00:13:21.340	Don Rumsfeld's a heavyweight that he's bringing in to this
175	00:13:21.350	00:13:25.100	team and I think he's going to have a seat,
176	00:13:25.110	00:13:27.490	a big seat at this table, and I think that
177	00:13:27.500	00:13:30.970	is very good for soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines and
178	00:13:30.980	00:13:34.350	also for the country in trying to define this security
179	00:13:34.360	00:13:38.600	strategy for the 21st century, absolutely essential. How do you
180	00:13:38.610	00:13:42.570	see it, John Isaacs? Donald Rumsfeld certainly is a heavyweight,
181	00:13:42.580	00:13:44.820	about you he also is a pretty hard line character.
182	00:13:44.830	00:13:46.270	I mean, he's one of the high priests of national
183	00:13:46.280	00:13:50.190	missile defense, the chairman of the commission that talked about
184	00:13:50.200	00:13:53.710	the missile defense...the threat from rogue nations of missiles.
185	00:13:53.720	00:13:56.970	He opposed the comprehensive test ban treaty that the Senate
186	00:13:56.980	00:14:00.150	voted on in 1999, which was consistent with President-elect Bush,
187	00:14:00.160	00:14:02.840	but he also opposed and testified against the chemical weapons
188	00:14:02.850	00:14:08.880	convention, which the first President Bush actually negotiated and he
189	00:14:08.890	00:14:11.450	opposed START II agreement. So he's been pretty hard line
190	00:14:11.460	00:14:13.450	on arms control. It'll be interesting to see what he
191	00:14:13.460	00:14:15.610	does as secretary of defense. What do you think of
192	00:14:15.620	00:14:17.610	the choice and what do you think it says about
193	00:14:17.620	00:14:20.680	President-elect Bush's priorities? I think it's an excellent choice. I
194	00:14:20.690	00:14:24.410	think Don Rumsfeld is a very talented and successful individual
195	00:14:24.420	00:14:28.420	and I think it says that President-elect Bush is willing
196	00:14:28.430	00:14:32.450	to have strong-willed, able people around him. He is not
197	00:14:32.460	00:14:37.320	one of these people who takes comfort from having yes
198	00:14:37.330	00:14:40.320	men or women around him. These are four remarkable people,
199	00:14:40.330	00:14:46.150	his national security team. The usual perception is that Republican
200	00:14:46.160	00:14:48.310	comes in, that means they're going to beef up defense.
201	00:14:48.320	00:14:50.250	But when you hear that both what he and Donald
202	00:14:50.260	00:14:53.000	Rumsfeld talked about, it sounded like there was also quite
203	00:14:53.010	00:14:56.610	a reform agenda--he talked about changing the Pentagon, changing
204	00:14:56.620	00:14:59.880	the military. Explain what that means to you, Jim Woolsey.
205	00:14:59.890	00:15:02.710	Well, there are changes that need to be made. But
206	00:15:02.720	00:15:04.590	a lot of what you need to do in the
207	00:15:04.600	00:15:07.470	Pentagon when you're not fighting is prepare to fight. And
208	00:15:07.480	00:15:11.460	that's largely the battle of the budget. There are savings
209	00:15:11.470	00:15:13.120	that can be made--a lot of them through I
210	00:15:13.130	00:15:16.380	think base closures and contracting out. But often Congress fights
211	00:15:16.390	00:15:19.660	those because it runs up against constituent interests in various
212	00:15:19.670	00:15:22.970	districts. The problem he's going to face is that, in
213	00:15:22.980	00:15:25.950	addition to improving readiness, which has been run down somewhat
214	00:15:25.960	00:15:29.720	from all of the peacekeeping deployments, and improving personnel and
215	00:15:29.730	00:15:33.660	quality of life for the soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, which
216	00:15:33.670	00:15:36.470	is going to cost money because the civilian economy's doing
217	00:15:36.480	00:15:39.830	so well, we're losing pilots in droves, for example, he's
218	00:15:39.840	00:15:42.680	going to need to recapitalize the Pentagon because a lot
219	00:15:42.690	00:15:45.410	of the equipment, the tanks, the ships, the aircraft that
220	00:15:45.420	00:15:48.480	were bought early in the Reagan administration are now coming
221	00:15:48.490	00:15:50.990	up toward the end of some of their useful life.
222	00:15:51.000	00:15:53.780	And we've had kind of a spending holiday on procurement
223	00:15:53.790	00:15:56.990	for the last eight years, and somebody's going to have
224	00:15:57.000	00:15:59.110	to make that up. So I think he's going to
225	00:15:59.120	00:16:02.120	have to spend, even with savings, tens of billions of
226	00:16:02.130	00:16:04.720	dollars a year more on the Pentagon than is now
227	00:16:04.730	00:16:07.200	being spent. We'll still be at an all time low
228	00:16:07.210	00:16:09.970	as with a share of the GNP going to defense,
229	00:16:09.980	00:16:13.040	but in absolute terms, that'll be a substantial increase, and
230	00:16:13.050	00:16:14.560	he's going to have a hard time getting some of
231	00:16:14.570	00:16:17.190	that I think through this very divided Congress. What did
232	00:16:17.200	00:16:21.280	you make, General, of this language about, you know, challenge
233	00:16:21.290	00:16:25.320	the status quo in the Pentagon and modernizing the military?
234	00:16:25.330	00:16:27.820	What do you think Bush and Rumsfeld are really talking
235	00:16:27.830	00:16:29.980	about, and what's the resistance to it? Well, first of
236	00:16:29.990	00:16:34.640	all, I've heard a consistent theme by the President-elect, by
237	00:16:34.650	00:16:40.090	secretary of state, the national security designee and by the
238	00:16:40.100	00:16:43.900	secretary of defense designee, and that is: What is needed
239	00:16:43.910	00:16:46.030	is some sort of clarity of mission. What is it
240	00:16:46.040	00:16:49.500	you want the Pentagon, what do you want the military
241	00:16:49.510	00:16:53.140	to do? And this clarity I think is absolutely essential
242	00:16:53.150	00:16:56.710	as we approach this multitude of threats that we have
243	00:16:56.720	00:17:00.360	in the 21st century, but more important are the opportunities
244	00:17:00.370	00:17:03.100	that we have. How do we work with our allies?
245	00:17:03.110	00:17:06.110	How do we consult not just inform? We have this
246	00:17:06.120	00:17:09.980	opportunity of leadership, and I think Don Rumsfeld and this
247	00:17:09.990	00:17:14.520	team provide a great opportunity to develop those with our
248	00:17:14.530	00:17:16.530	allies and with our partners and our friends and send
249	00:17:16.540	00:17:20.930	a clear message to our adversaries. Which is...Which is
250	00:17:20.940	00:17:23.990	that the United States is going to participate, is going
251	00:17:24.000	00:17:29.210	to provide that leadership and is going to redesign or
252	00:17:29.220	00:17:32.420	adapt our military to meet threats that we face in
253	00:17:32.430	00:17:35.090	the 21st century. And, John Isaacs, how do you read
254	00:17:35.100	00:17:39.110	the language about readapting, challenging the status quo? Well, what
255	00:17:39.120	00:17:41.870	the President talked about and what Rumsfeld talked about is
256	00:17:41.880	00:17:44.420	preparing for the kind of challenges we will face in
257	00:17:44.430	00:17:47.240	the next decade and next decades. But that does not
258	00:17:47.250	00:17:50.190	include building a lot of these what other people call
259	00:17:50.200	00:17:53.130	the legacy weapons, the weapons really were designed to confront
260	00:17:53.140	00:17:56.480	the Soviet Union during the Cold War. And President-elect Bush
261	00:17:56.490	00:17:59.230	talked about skipping generations of weapons, and that could mean
262	00:17:59.240	00:18:02.420	challenging some of the major weapons programs within the Pentagon,
263	00:18:02.430	00:18:06.030	perhaps the joint strike fighter, the F-22 for the Air
264	00:18:06.040	00:18:10.960	Force plane, the F-18/EF for the Navy, and if Rumsfeld
265	00:18:10.970	00:18:12.720	and Bush actually want to tackle this, they're going to
266	00:18:12.730	00:18:16.080	tackle major constituencies in Congress and major bureaucracies in the
267	00:18:16.090	00:18:18.450	Pentagon, and I don't know whether that team and whether
268	00:18:18.460	00:18:20.240	Rumsfeld is strong enough to do that. Do you agree
269	00:18:20.250	00:18:23.260	with that, General, about the constituencies? I mean, somebody's ox
270	00:18:23.270	00:18:26.510	is going to get gored if you're really changing things.
271	00:18:26.520	00:18:28.770	I think you need to set the strategy and that's
272	00:18:28.780	00:18:31.920	the President, has to set that strategy for his national
273	00:18:31.930	00:18:36.130	security team and soon. And then what follows from that
274	00:18:36.140	00:18:41.480	strategy are the procurement items that need to be developed
275	00:18:41.490	00:18:44.410	and the training and the readiness, all of that follows
276	00:18:44.420	00:18:47.370	the strategy. But until you have that clarity, it's very
277	00:18:47.380	00:18:51.340	hard to say what constituencies are going to be...Don’t
278	00:18:51.350	00:18:53.950	build this or don't build that? And that's been part
279	00:18:53.960	00:18:57.870	of our problems that we've had, to me, in the
280	00:18:57.880	00:19:00.970	past. And I think the President and his team early
281	00:19:00.980	00:19:04.620	on need to set that strategy and set those priorities.
282	00:19:04.630	00:19:08.520	What do you make of, one, how extensive a reforming,
283	00:19:08.530	00:19:13.010	revamping job lies ahead; and whether Rumsfeld is well-equipped to
284	00:19:13.020	00:19:15.170	do this, having worked so closely with him on that
285	00:19:15.180	00:19:16.970	mission? I think he's superbly equipped to do it. He's
286	00:19:16.980	00:19:20.710	a good leader, he's firm. He manages by his out
287	00:19:20.720	00:19:23.600	box, not his in box. But he has a very
288	00:19:23.610	00:19:25.690	good sense of humor. Explain that. He manages by...He
289	00:19:25.700	00:19:30.880	sets priorities, he sets deadlines, he imposes, I think, his
290	00:19:30.890	00:19:34.920	structure on an organization. But he is a man who
291	00:19:34.930	00:19:39.850	tolerates disagreement well; he likes to have argument. He has
292	00:19:39.860	00:19:41.580	a very good sense of humor, and that makes things
293	00:19:41.590	00:19:45.090	I think go better. I think the problem is that
294	00:19:45.100	00:19:47.710	the period we're in now is a period in which
295	00:19:47.720	00:19:50.580	the threats are not clear. We may need to deal
296	00:19:50.590	00:19:52.510	with China in the Taiwan Straits, we may need to
297	00:19:52.520	00:19:54.540	deal with North Korea coming in--South Korea and we
298	00:19:54.550	00:19:57.410	may need to deal with Iraq coming against Kuwait again.
299	00:19:57.420	00:19:59.140	The situation is much more to the way it was
300	00:19:59.150	00:20:01.780	say in the '20s or early 1930's after we had
301	00:20:01.790	00:20:03.740	won World War I. That this time we won the Cold
302	00:20:03.750	00:20:08.170	War, but there isn't a single threat. So although we
303	00:20:08.180	00:20:11.620	can hope for clarity in the sense of being precise
304	00:20:11.630	00:20:15.320	about what we're trying to do, we can't really hope
305	00:20:15.330	00:20:19.640	for clarity in picking a single foe and organizing to
306	00:20:19.650	00:20:22.940	defeat him the way we did in the Cold War.
307	00:20:22.950	00:20:25.950	Now, national missile defense, John Isaacs, you mentioned this originally
308	00:20:25.960	00:20:29.190	when we went around and so did the President-elect. Does
309	00:20:29.200	00:20:32.440	this signal to you that Bush is really serious about
310	00:20:32.450	00:20:37.460	pushing this? And what difference can it make if a
311	00:20:37.470	00:20:41.230	Donald Rumsfeld is defense secretary? I don't think there's any
312	00:20:41.240	00:20:43.740	question that the president and his team is committed to
313	00:20:43.750	00:20:46.700	national missile defense. Although that does not necessarily mean that
314	00:20:46.710	00:20:49.430	they are committed to deployment anytime soon. If you listen
315	00:20:49.440	00:20:52.250	to the President-elect's word today, he said, "we're going for
316	00:20:52.260	00:20:54.600	a missile defense system that works." And one thing that's
317	00:20:54.610	00:20:56.670	clear today is that there's no missile defense system that
318	00:20:56.680	00:20:58.870	works. The technology isn't there? The technology is not ready.
319	00:20:58.880	00:21:01.930	Moreover, the Republican Party has a split between those who
320	00:21:01.940	00:21:05.150	want to build the Bill Clinton missile defense system, starting
321	00:21:05.160	00:21:08.270	with land-based deployment in Alaska, and then expand from there
322	00:21:08.280	00:21:11.570	perhaps to missile defense at sea and in space, and
323	00:21:11.580	00:21:14.020	those including I believe Jim Woolsey who say let's junk
324	00:21:14.030	00:21:17.790	the Clinton plan and started all over again and build
325	00:21:17.800	00:21:20.860	an expanded system in sea and in space. And I
326	00:21:20.870	00:21:23.460	don't know where Rumsfeld stands on this, but this is
327	00:21:23.470	00:21:25.460	not going to be an easy decision for the Republican
328	00:21:25.470	00:21:28.780	Party and for this administration. Weigh in on this, Jim
329	00:21:28.790	00:21:30.490	Woolsey. I think we do need to move to a
330	00:21:30.500	00:21:34.040	national missile defense. You mean of the kind that Bush
331	00:21:34.050	00:21:37.730	sketched out? Well, he hasn't been precise yet about exactly
332	00:21:37.740	00:21:39.230	what he was going to do, but I do think
333	00:21:39.240	00:21:43.170	the Clinton administration system was badly conceived. The mid course
334	00:21:43.180	00:21:46.590	system that Clinton proposed really is trying to hit a
335	00:21:46.600	00:21:48.330	bullet with a bullet. It's the hardest way to do
336	00:21:48.340	00:21:51.730	missile defense. I guess what I'm really asking is: What's
337	00:21:51.740	00:21:54.430	your sense of where Donald Rumsfeld is on that? I
338	00:21:54.440	00:21:57.330	don't know. The only thing I'm confident on is that
339	00:21:57.340	00:22:00.040	he'll look at it objectively, hear the best arguments and
340	00:22:00.050	00:22:02.660	make a clear recommendation to the President. I think he'll
341	00:22:02.670	00:22:04.840	be very business like about it. I think he is
342	00:22:04.850	00:22:07.690	committed, as I take it the President-elect is, to having
343	00:22:07.700	00:22:10.790	a national missile defense, but what kind I don't know.
344	00:22:10.800	00:22:12.860	But he would have a real sales job with, for
345	00:22:12.870	00:22:15.640	instance, our European allies, wouldn't he, General Joulwan? Absolutely. But
346	00:22:15.650	00:22:18.750	again, this is the consultation that I talk about not
347	00:22:18.760	00:22:23.430	just informing. The Europeans would call it theater missile defense,
348	00:22:23.440	00:22:27.060	and there is a proposal, an initiative in NATO to
349	00:22:27.070	00:22:29.930	study that. So I think if we have the leadership
350	00:22:29.940	00:22:34.610	here, that this new administration can consult with our allies
351	00:22:34.620	00:22:38.920	on their theater missile defense, as we also talk about
352	00:22:38.930	00:22:42.720	national missile defense, as well. Finally, John Isaacs, how do
353	00:22:42.730	00:22:46.000	you think Rumsfeld will fit into this team? You have
354	00:22:46.010	00:22:48.930	of course Colin Powell, secretary of state, Condi Rice, national
355	00:22:48.940	00:22:54.750	security advisor, Dick Cheney, the 800-pound whatever, former defense secretary.
356	00:22:54.760	00:22:57.080	There was a lot of question about whoever took this
357	00:22:57.090	00:23:00.200	job, would they be overshadowed? What's your sense of Rumsfeld
358	00:23:00.210	00:23:01.930	and his ability to go toe to toe? Well, I
359	00:23:01.940	00:23:03.970	think Rumsfeld is a pretty strong figure, he will be
360	00:23:03.980	00:23:06.570	able to go toe to toe with the team. But
361	00:23:06.580	00:23:11.170	there's a real potential for major divisions within this administration.
362	00:23:11.180	00:23:13.310	When you're force when you force such strong figures, what
363	00:23:13.320	00:23:15.870	you need is a very strong President to make the
364	00:23:15.880	00:23:18.660	decision to choose between the options presented by the different
365	00:23:18.670	00:23:21.830	teams, and this is not President-elect Bush's strongest field, shall
366	00:23:21.840	00:23:24.790	we say mildly. And so if there is a disagreement,
367	00:23:24.800	00:23:26.290	I'm not sure who's going to settle it, unless it's
368	00:23:26.300	00:23:31.760	Condoleezza Rice, the national security advisor elect or select. President-elect
369	00:23:31.770	00:23:33.890	Bush said he hoped there would be disagreements. Do you
370	00:23:33.900	00:23:36.340	see--where do you see the fault lines or do
371	00:23:36.350	00:23:38.550	you see any fault lines in this team potentially. I’m
372	00:23:38.560	00:23:42.060	not sure there will be any continuing fault lines. They'll
373	00:23:42.070	00:23:47.050	disagree on things because they're all smart and people of
374	00:23:47.060	00:23:53.090	forceful will. But the interesting thing is that Colin Powell
375	00:23:53.100	00:23:55.860	and Condi Rice both have a reputation and have explicitly
376	00:23:55.870	00:23:59.040	said they're reluctant to use U.S. troops abroad, more reluctant
377	00:23:59.050	00:24:02.120	than the Clinton administration has proven to be. And often
378	00:24:02.130	00:24:06.230	the secretary of defense is the one who says, "look,
379	00:24:06.240	00:24:09.190	I'm not really sure we want to use force. Here
380	00:24:09.200	00:24:12.170	are the criteria, here is why it could be difficult."
381	00:24:12.180	00:24:14.280	The secretary of defense often is sort of dragged along
382	00:24:14.290	00:24:16.580	in many administrations to using force if you...Whereas it's
383	00:24:16.590	00:24:18.880	usually the secretary of state who's saying, "get in there."
384	00:24:18.890	00:24:22.990	Sometimes that's the case. It'll be interesting to see if
385	00:24:23.000	00:24:25.440	that's what happens here, if so, you may have everybody
386	00:24:25.450	00:24:28.500	being reluctant to use force. It's my hunch that these
387	00:24:28.510	00:24:32.770	people are pragmatic enough that each case is going to
388	00:24:32.780	00:24:35.690	be on its own merits and you'll have a lot
389	00:24:35.700	00:24:39.910	of vigorous discussion among strong-willed people. The president will make
390	00:24:39.920	00:24:42.690	the final decision. Do you see that possibility, general, that
391	00:24:42.700	00:24:46.950	you could have a team of reluctant warriors? Well, I
392	00:24:46.960	00:24:49.510	think just the opposite. I think you're going to get
393	00:24:49.520	00:24:52.810	from both the State Department and Defense Department, particularly with
394	00:24:52.820	00:24:56.090	someone like Colin Powell who understands what conditions you need
395	00:24:56.100	00:24:59.190	before you commit forces, you're going to find someone that's
396	00:24:59.200	00:25:01.990	going to fight diplomatically to get those conditions, to work
397	00:25:02.000	00:25:05.020	with our allies, to make sure you have rules of
398	00:25:05.030	00:25:08.030	engagement, for example, that can work before you commit the
399	00:25:08.040	00:25:10.860	force. So I see a sympathetic ear in the State
400	00:25:10.870	00:25:14.090	Department and a Don Rumsfeld who's very strong that's going
401	00:25:14.100	00:25:16.950	to insist on those conditions before we commit the force.
402	00:25:16.960	00:25:21.510	So I really see not so much argument as much
403	00:25:21.520	00:25:24.870	as complementing one another on the vital issue of when
404	00:25:24.880	00:25:28.310	you commit forces. Can I say something on that? This
405	00:25:28.320	00:25:30.930	is an area with potential major disagreement with our European
406	00:25:30.940	00:25:33.740	allies. The specific test case in the first year is
407	00:25:33.750	00:25:37.060	whether U.S. troops remain in Bosnia and Kosovo. During the
408	00:25:37.070	00:25:40.780	campaign, President-elect Bush talked about getting U.S. Troops out. Well,
409	00:25:40.790	00:25:43.180	the European allies say, "we have 80% of the troops
410	00:25:43.190	00:25:46.010	there--the U.S. should have a major role there, too."
411	00:25:46.020	00:25:48.630	And I don't know where Rumsfeld and Powell and the
412	00:25:48.640	00:25:51.230	whole team are going to come down. So both missile
413	00:25:51.240	00:25:54.150	defense and troops in the former Yugoslavia are major areas
414	00:25:54.160	00:25:56.770	of potential disagreement. I know you want to jump in--
415	00:25:56.780	00:26:00.410	very briefly. Yes, that's where consultation comes in. The Europeans
416	00:26:00.420	00:26:03.980	are building a European force. There's a great opportunity, I
417	00:26:03.990	00:26:06.200	think, it can be a win-win with what we would
418	00:26:06.210	00:26:07.830	like to do in the United States and what our
419	00:26:07.840	00:26:11.900	European allies can do. We need to consult with them.
420	00:26:11.910	00:26:13.160	All right, and we have to leave it there. Thank
421	00:26:13.170	00:26:24.260	you all three very much. Still to come on the
422	00:26:24.270	00:26:28.870	NewsHour tonight, the changing face of philanthropy, a cell phone
423	00:26:28.880	00:26:33.050	update, and some perspective on the year 2000. Business correspondent
424	00:26:33.060	00:26:36.200	Paul Solman of WGBH, Boston, looks at a new breed
425	00:26:36.210	00:26:45.550	of philanthropists. These future leaders are inner city kids attending
426	00:26:45.560	00:26:49.770	a privately run after school program called Citizen School. You
427	00:26:49.780	00:26:51.950	want the skills, you want the leadership, but you think
428	00:26:51.960	00:26:54.540	access to good jobs, good mentors, good high school opportunities...
429	00:26:54.550	00:26:57.850	The citizens, volunteer experts, come in to teach everything from
430	00:26:57.860	00:27:01.110	city planning to law...What kind of files are they?
431	00:27:01.120	00:27:04.850	...Computers to cooking. We've got our bruchetta out of the
432	00:27:04.860	00:27:07.210	oven now. Kids who say they'd otherwise be on the
433	00:27:07.220	00:27:10.780	street, or home watching cartoons, are here after school every
434	00:27:10.790	00:27:16.390	day learning serious skills. New worlds. New worlds. In short,
435	00:27:16.400	00:27:21.060	time-honored social activism. One of those thousands of nonprofit points
436	00:27:21.070	00:27:25.610	of light. But, the people funding this operation, sure don't
437	00:27:25.620	00:27:29.590	sound like typical social activists. It's so hard to grow
438	00:27:29.600	00:27:32.430	a social innovation. Let's put our full profit investor head
439	00:27:32.440	00:27:34.700	on head on. You have to start building your capacity.
440	00:27:34.710	00:27:37.300	Going to scale by spreading your best practices.
441	00:27:37.310	00:27:38.770	I want to incentivize people to do
442	00:27:38.780	00:27:42.650	better. Price wars, competition, marketing strategies, all of that good
443	00:27:42.660	00:27:46.450	stuff. Yes, those women are social activists, but they sound
444	00:27:46.460	00:27:51.030	an awful lot like hardcore businesspeople. Actually, they're both. Kelly
445	00:27:51.040	00:27:54.280	Fitzsimmons and Vanessa Kirsch run an outfit called New Profit
446	00:27:54.290	00:27:57.810	Inc., and are using concepts and cash from the dot-com
447	00:27:57.820	00:28:02.380	revolution to try to revolutionize philanthropy. And if you, like
448	00:28:02.390	00:28:05.580	me, are currently sorting through the ton of plaintiff charity
449	00:28:05.590	00:28:08.430	solicitations that come through the mail slot this time of
450	00:28:08.440	00:28:11.720	year, and not knowing how to choose among them, you,
451	00:28:11.730	00:28:14.310	too, might think a revolution was in order. Imagine if
452	00:28:14.320	00:28:16.680	we were starting a new profit sector, a sector that
453	00:28:16.690	00:28:20.050	was devoted to trying to help social issues and social
454	00:28:20.060	00:28:22.800	problems in our society, but that was using the principles
455	00:28:22.810	00:28:27.030	of a marketplace, and of competition, and of performance and
456	00:28:27.040	00:28:31.450	of rewards and accountability. What we do is we have
457	00:28:31.460	00:28:36.340	opted to produce and create a new type of funding
458	00:28:36.350	00:28:41.150	that we call venture philanthropy. We've taken cues, practices, ideas,
459	00:28:41.160	00:28:46.720	approaches, from venture capital. Venture philanthropy organizations are popping up
460	00:28:46.730	00:28:51.280	nearly everywhere and gave $40 million in grants last year--
461	00:28:51.290	00:28:55.860	only a fraction of the $190 billion charitable giving industry,
462	00:28:55.870	00:28:58.900	but a growing fraction that addresses one of the common
463	00:28:58.910	00:29:05.530	woes of conventional charity. Traditionally, foundations fund small, needy programs
464	00:29:05.540	00:29:09.020	for short periods of time--as Vanessa Kirsch herself found
465	00:29:09.030	00:29:12.480	out, when she ran a small nonprofit that started to
466	00:29:12.490	00:29:15.710	lose its funding, just as it started to take off.
467	00:29:15.720	00:29:18.460	The foundation started saying, "you know, you're too big. You
468	00:29:18.470	00:29:21.210	can't grow so fast," or, "we can't give you money.
469	00:29:21.220	00:29:24.600	You're too successful." And I'm thinking, well, what? How can
470	00:29:24.610	00:29:26.420	you ever grow something if... I mean, what, I'm supposed
471	00:29:26.430	00:29:30.630	to be not successful? New Profit Inc. From that experience,
472	00:29:30.640	00:29:34.180	Kirsch and Fitzsimmons created New Profit, Inc., a foundation that
473	00:29:34.190	00:29:37.060	raises money from a pool of wealthy new donors to
474	00:29:37.070	00:29:41.140	finance a small group of social entrepreneurs who are aching
475	00:29:41.150	00:29:45.870	to expand their programs. New Profit offers sustained funding, a
476	00:29:45.880	00:29:49.240	million dollars or more spread over several years, and provides
477	00:29:49.250	00:29:53.980	hands-on business help, as well. Social entrepreneur Ned Rimer, co-founded
478	00:29:53.990	00:29:57.830	Citizen Schools, where he, too, uses business school skills to
479	00:29:57.840	00:30:01.820	work on his ambitious goal of taking the program nationwide.
480	00:30:01.830	00:30:04.580	I could have described citizen schools as an after school
481	00:30:04.590	00:30:07.310	program in Boston, period. But that's different than what we're
482	00:30:07.320	00:30:09.600	trying to do. We really are trying to change the
483	00:30:09.610	00:30:12.920	way kids grow up in this country. Planning and architecture...
484	00:30:12.930	00:30:16.330	Making change on a national scale. You hear that a
485	00:30:16.340	00:30:19.320	lot in the world of venture philanthropy. You also hear
486	00:30:19.330	00:30:22.710	a lot about measurable results, because that's what the dot-com
487	00:30:22.720	00:30:25.270	donors believe in. More buildings so people could live in
488	00:30:25.280	00:30:30.530	there. Our donors, this new generation, they're not charity, they're
489	00:30:30.540	00:30:33.610	not...it's not about charity; it's about investment. It's just
490	00:30:33.620	00:30:36.270	about investment in the nonprofit sector, and they do expect
491	00:30:36.280	00:30:39.980	results, and they do want to see accountability. Well, it
492	00:30:39.990	00:30:44.430	certainly sounds good, but wait a second. Results in the
493	00:30:44.440	00:30:49.220	for-profit sector are easy enough to measure, in profits. But
494	00:30:49.230	00:30:53.330	how do you measure the results from nonprofit social activism?
495	00:30:53.340	00:30:56.540	Paul, you can measure anything. Robert Kaplan is co-creator of
496	00:30:56.550	00:30:59.930	the balance scorecard, a system that firms like Mobil Oil
497	00:30:59.940	00:31:04.820	have adopted sometimes to considerable advantage. The balance scorecard forces
498	00:31:04.830	00:31:08.300	organizations to clearly define their goals then come up with
499	00:31:08.310	00:31:11.220	a set of measures, the score card, to track progress
500	00:31:11.230	00:31:15.180	in meeting them. One of Mobil's goals for its retail
501	00:31:15.190	00:31:18.530	gas division, was to provide customers with a fast, friendly
502	00:31:18.540	00:31:21.020	experience at the pump. And they put that on the
503	00:31:21.030	00:31:23.040	scorecard, and they measured it, you know, the nature of
504	00:31:23.050	00:31:27.210	the buying experience. And every employee understood that this is
505	00:31:27.220	00:31:30.540	the way the company needed to succeed. And somebody deep
506	00:31:30.550	00:31:34.540	in the organization, in the marketing technology group is thinking,
507	00:31:34.550	00:31:37.430	"can we produce this little device that people can carry
508	00:31:37.440	00:31:39.930	on their key chains," which he calls, you know, a
509	00:31:39.940	00:31:42.930	speed pass, "and they can just go up to the
510	00:31:42.940	00:31:45.870	gasoline pump and it you press it against that, and
511	00:31:45.880	00:31:48.550	it says, "hey, it's Bob Kaplan, charge it to his
512	00:31:48.560	00:31:53.850	credit card." Speed password for Mobil; the scorecard got the
513	00:31:53.860	00:31:58.620	credit. Kaplan realized the balance scorecard might help define goals
514	00:31:58.630	00:32:02.590	and measure results in the nonprofit world, as well. I
515	00:32:02.600	00:32:04.840	mean I get solicitations, as I'm sure you do, from
516	00:32:04.850	00:32:07.600	nonprofits all the time. They keep telling you what they
517	00:32:07.610	00:32:09.570	do. You know, we're going to do this program, we're
518	00:32:09.580	00:32:12.300	going to do this initiative, and I never see on
519	00:32:12.310	00:32:16.430	the solicitation what have they achieved? How do I know
520	00:32:16.440	00:32:19.120	whether they've been successful? What difference have they made in
521	00:32:19.130	00:32:24.490	people's lives? Not anecdotes, but measures. Completely missing. I can
522	00:32:24.500	00:32:27.420	tell you that I was debating somebody, a foundation about
523	00:32:27.430	00:32:30.540	the different models, and they said, "we have 100% success
524	00:32:30.550	00:32:33.170	rate." And I said, "based on what, like how do
525	00:32:33.180	00:32:35.320	you know?" "Well, we gave all the money away." That
526	00:32:35.330	00:32:38.520	was their definition of success. To prove to donors that
527	00:32:38.530	00:32:41.930	their programs make a measurable difference, Fitzsimmons and Kirsch worked
528	00:32:41.940	00:32:46.560	with Kaplan to adapt the balance scorecard. New Profit, Inc.,
529	00:32:46.570	00:32:49.070	and all the groups it funds, must show that their
530	00:32:49.080	00:32:53.300	scores improve year to year or risk losing funding. I
531	00:32:53.310	00:32:57.510	think we'd all really appreciate your feedback. Citizen school's scorecard,
532	00:32:57.520	00:33:01.190	for example, includes improving students' skills, increasing the number of
533	00:33:01.200	00:33:05.590	volunteers. Wasn't that delicious? Another group funded by New Profit
534	00:33:05.600	00:33:10.650	is Jumpstart, which provides tutoring for low-income pre-schoolers. CEO Aaron
535	00:33:10.660	00:33:14.040	Lieberman. There's a lot of research that suggests, for kids
536	00:33:14.050	00:33:16.720	who are prepared when they get to kindergarten, they'll likely
537	00:33:16.730	00:33:18.670	be successful for the rest of their life in terms
538	00:33:18.680	00:33:20.370	of being able to get the most out of school,
539	00:33:20.380	00:33:22.340	go on to high school, college and so forth. Now
540	00:33:22.350	00:33:25.310	you're up here on an individual kid. At a pre-school
541	00:33:25.320	00:33:29.640	outside Boston, we were shown an internet-based program Jumpstart had
542	00:33:29.650	00:33:35.230	created to help teachers update parents about their children's progress.
543	00:33:35.240	00:33:38.410	In a good example of the new market approach, Jumpstart
544	00:33:38.420	00:33:41.870	has now formed a for-profit spin-off company to sell the
545	00:33:41.880	00:33:44.740	program to private schools like this one. It'll be great
546	00:33:44.750	00:33:47.110	for the children and the core members in Jumpstart, and
547	00:33:47.120	00:33:49.190	they'll always be able to use these tools. But we
548	00:33:49.200	00:33:51.270	realize there's also a market for this and we can
549	00:33:51.280	00:33:54.010	sell this to the larger public and create a company
550	00:33:54.020	00:33:56.850	in which Jumpstart is the leading shareholder. It's a true
551	00:33:56.860	00:34:00.410	new profit. Now, all this talk of profits raised another
552	00:34:00.420	00:34:04.140	question: The social entrepreneurs we talked to were bright folks
553	00:34:04.150	00:34:07.490	with glitzy business credentials who could be making much more
554	00:34:07.500	00:34:11.010	money in the for-profit sector. So how much salary should
555	00:34:11.020	00:34:13.400	a person be expected to sacrifice to work for the
556	00:34:13.410	00:34:17.250	public good? Ned Rimer acknowledged the key reward of most
557	00:34:17.260	00:34:21.560	social activists. Psychic income and I think it's huge. It's
558	00:34:21.570	00:34:23.940	being able to see the impact you're having on a
559	00:34:23.950	00:34:28.880	community to me is worth a lot of dollars. But
560	00:34:28.890	00:34:31.870	New Profit co-founder Kelly Fitzsimmons says, that if you want
561	00:34:31.880	00:34:35.070	to attract and keep top people to run productive social
562	00:34:35.080	00:34:40.130	enterprises, you should pay them competitively. I guess the medium
563	00:34:40.140	00:34:43.130	sized nonprofit organization, we should be paying people that are
564	00:34:43.140	00:34:46.990	running those things six-figure salaries. And maybe, you know, in
565	00:34:47.000	00:34:49.730	the lower end of the six figures. When you mean
566	00:34:49.740	00:34:52.140	six figures, you mean $200,000 a year? Or $100,000, $100,000
567	00:34:52.150	00:34:57.660	to $200,000. Fitzsimmons makes $100,000 a year. The social entrepreneurs
568	00:34:57.670	00:35:01.860	she funds for the moment make considerably less. Historically, of
569	00:35:01.870	00:35:04.420	course, donors have been reluctant to give money if they
570	00:35:04.430	00:35:08.520	thought salaries were too high, but that may be changing.
571	00:35:08.530	00:35:12.440	Venture philanthropists after all, have a new model designed to
572	00:35:12.450	00:35:16.160	achieve the loftiest of ambitions. I want to say that
573	00:35:16.170	00:35:19.080	we can end hunger in America, and I don't think
574	00:35:19.090	00:35:21.990	that is impossible. With the kind of money and resources
575	00:35:22.000	00:35:24.800	and intellectual capital we have in America, we should be
576	00:35:24.810	00:35:27.870	able to solve major social problems. Who would argue with
577	00:35:27.880	00:35:32.370	that? Well, Peter Karoff, long time advisor to donors and
578	00:35:32.380	00:35:36.900	philanthropists worries that the ambition behind venture philanthropy has a
579	00:35:36.910	00:35:41.920	downside. Where you make a mistake is where you overstate
580	00:35:41.930	00:35:45.090	and you make statements like, "we're going to completely eliminate
581	00:35:45.100	00:35:48.810	illiteracy in America today," and then five or seven, eight
582	00:35:48.820	00:35:51.460	years from now you haven't done it. And what you've
583	00:35:51.470	00:35:55.030	done again is raise expectations, you've been like the politicians,
584	00:35:55.040	00:35:58.610	beyond the ability to execute. So now, if we look
585	00:35:58.620	00:36:01.060	at it on here, though...But ultimately, the worth of
586	00:36:01.070	00:36:04.430	any social enterprise is the effect it has on people's
587	00:36:04.440	00:36:10.400	lives. So we conducted our own perhaps unbalanced scorecard, a
588	00:36:10.410	00:36:13.330	casual survey on what kids were getting out of Citizen
589	00:36:13.340	00:36:15.660	Schools. If I was to sit here and talk to
590	00:36:15.670	00:36:19.070	you before, say four years ago, I couldn't do it,
591	00:36:19.080	00:36:21.640	couldn't do it because I would just get all extra
592	00:36:21.650	00:36:23.610	shy, I'd be like, "oh, my God." I wouldn't be
593	00:36:23.620	00:36:25.200	able to speak, I wouldn't be able to form a
594	00:36:25.210	00:36:28.650	proper sentence. How does it prepare you for later in
595	00:36:28.660	00:36:34.730	life? We had a stock market/business class where our teacher
596	00:36:34.740	00:36:37.040	showed us how to do stock market. He showed us
597	00:36:37.050	00:36:39.290	how to use it. I was like, "wow, that's easy."
598	00:36:39.300	00:36:41.070	Then he said, "okay, now, everybody's going to have to
599	00:36:41.080	00:36:43.860	take a certain stock and we have to follow it
600	00:36:43.870	00:36:46.620	from now until the end of the semester. So I
601	00:36:46.630	00:36:53.570	took Microsoft. My stock is up to $14,1700 and 53
602	00:36:53.580	00:36:58.000	cents. Microsoft's been taking a beating lately. Are you aware
603	00:36:58.010	00:37:03.410	of that? Yes. It could be down. Microsoft leads to
604	00:37:03.420	00:37:07.280	a last point about venture philanthropy's promise--to bring to
605	00:37:07.290	00:37:11.220	charity, says Robert Kaplan, the dynamic growth of the profit-seeking
606	00:37:11.230	00:37:16.120	sector. Half of the top companies, Microsofts, Intels, Home Depots
607	00:37:16.130	00:37:20.810	have occurred since 1967. You look at the same statistics,
608	00:37:20.820	00:37:25.080	which are the larger social service organizations. In the top
609	00:37:25.090	00:37:30.240	25, maybe one or two has been created since 1967.
610	00:37:30.250	00:37:32.990	And New Profit, Inc., is trying to, through this venture
611	00:37:33.000	00:37:37.030	capital, you know, create the Microsofts and the Intels and
612	00:37:37.040	00:37:40.460	the Cisco Systems of the social sector. In other words,
613	00:37:40.470	00:37:44.080	venture philanthropy is trying to incubate the new superstars of
614	00:37:44.090	00:37:48.840	the nonprofit sector. It's a presumptuous goal, and a major
615	00:37:48.850	00:38:00.900	challenge to how the business of philanthropy currently works. There’s
616	00:38:00.910	00:38:04.580	some new research on whether cell phones pose health risks.
617	00:38:04.590	00:38:08.250	Correspondent Susan Dentzer of our health unit updates the story.
618	00:38:08.260	00:38:10.550	The unit is a partnership with the Henry J. Kaiser
619	00:38:10.560	00:38:16.310	Family Foundation. More than 90 million Americans and at least
620	00:38:16.320	00:38:19.910	half a billion people worldwide, depend on cellular phones to
621	00:38:19.920	00:38:24.450	stay in close touch but as cell phone use has
622	00:38:24.460	00:38:28.570	grown, so have concerns that the radio frequency signals that
623	00:38:28.580	00:38:31.400	carry sound from phone to phone could have harmful health
624	00:38:31.410	00:38:35.050	effects. There have been fears that signals emitted from the
625	00:38:35.060	00:38:39.100	antennas of handheld cell phones could cause brain cancer, or
626	00:38:39.110	00:38:42.910	that the signals could cause genetic damage in human blood.
627	00:38:42.920	00:38:47.240	For example, several high-profile lawsuits have been filed alleging damage
628	00:38:47.250	00:38:50.990	from cell phones. Last summer, a Maryland neurologist asked for
629	00:38:51.000	00:38:55.950	$800 million in damages against Motorola and Verizon, charging that
630	00:38:55.960	00:38:59.200	his cell phone use had caused brain cancer. That case
631	00:38:59.210	00:39:02.440	is now pending. And in a recent book that garnered
632	00:39:02.450	00:39:06.400	media attention, one researcher, Dr. George Carlo, claimed that he
633	00:39:06.410	00:39:09.370	had found evidence linking cell phone use to both brain
634	00:39:09.380	00:39:13.450	cancer and genetic damage to blood cells. But in contrast
635	00:39:13.460	00:39:17.110	to some users' fears, and to concerns raised by Carlo
636	00:39:17.120	00:39:20.950	and a handful of other researchers, two new studies suggest
637	00:39:20.960	00:39:24.480	no statistical link between cell phone use and brain cancer.
638	00:39:24.490	00:39:26.700	The first, published last week in the "Journal of the
639	00:39:26.710	00:39:31.670	American Medical Association," compared a group of 469 men and
640	00:39:31.680	00:39:34.960	women with brain cancer with a slightly smaller group of
641	00:39:34.970	00:39:39.680	people without the disease. 66 of the cancer patients reported
642	00:39:39.690	00:39:43.310	using handheld cellular telephones for an average of just under
643	00:39:43.320	00:39:46.690	three years, as did 76 of the patients who were
644	00:39:46.700	00:39:51.630	well. A statistical analysis showed no connection between brain cancer
645	00:39:51.640	00:39:55.400	and cell phone use, says Joshua Muscat, the lead researcher
646	00:39:55.410	00:39:59.680	in the study. We found that regardless of how frequently
647	00:39:59.690	00:40:02.420	the phones were used per month or how many years
648	00:40:02.430	00:40:06.610	that the phones were used, there wasn't any relationship with
649	00:40:06.620	00:40:10.210	the developments of brain cancer. Not only was there no
650	00:40:10.220	00:40:14.020	apparent link to cancer, there was also no indication that
651	00:40:14.030	00:40:16.900	cancers appeared more often on the side of the head
652	00:40:16.910	00:40:20.400	where patients tended to use the phones--that seemed to
653	00:40:20.410	00:40:23.950	strengthen the case that the phones' radio frequency signals weren't
654	00:40:23.960	00:40:27.530	harmful. Radio frequency waves are low-energy waves. They are not
655	00:40:27.540	00:40:30.890	like x-rays, which have been shown to cause genetic damage.
656	00:40:30.900	00:40:35.300	They don't produce any harmful physiological effects that we know
657	00:40:35.310	00:40:39.380	of. A second, even larger study by researchers at the
658	00:40:39.390	00:40:43.840	National Cancer Institute yielded similar results. In this one, to
659	00:40:43.850	00:40:46.630	be published in January in the "New England Journal of
660	00:40:46.640	00:40:52.320	Medicine," researchers examined the cases of 782 hospitalized patients with
661	00:40:52.330	00:40:56.960	various forms of brain cancer; they compared them to 799
662	00:40:56.970	00:41:01.010	other hospital patients without brain cancer. Of the two groups,
663	00:41:01.020	00:41:05.830	311 of the brain cancer patients had used cellular phones,
664	00:41:05.840	00:41:11.200	versus 359 of those who were cancer-free. Once again, researchers
665	00:41:11.210	00:41:14.640	found no evidence of increased risk of cancer from cell
666	00:41:14.650	00:41:19.600	phone use. Despite the new studies' seemingly good news, even
667	00:41:19.610	00:41:22.260	the researchers who conducted them warned that it was far
668	00:41:22.270	00:41:25.470	too soon to grant cell phone use a completely clean
669	00:41:25.480	00:41:27.940	bill of health. Cell phones have only been around for
670	00:41:27.950	00:41:31.540	a few years and so most people who have used
671	00:41:31.550	00:41:34.170	cell phones have used them on average for about two
672	00:41:34.180	00:41:36.980	or three years. We need to keep in mind that
673	00:41:36.990	00:41:42.390	there might be unknown effects associated with longer usage, and
674	00:41:42.400	00:41:46.640	so that needs to be studied in the future. Meanwhile,
675	00:41:46.650	00:41:50.030	cell phone producers have started to disclose just how much
676	00:41:50.040	00:41:53.750	radiation their phones emit. These are stated in terms of
677	00:41:53.760	00:41:59.000	so-called "SARs," or specific absorption rates, that indicate the number
678	00:41:59.010	00:42:02.380	of watts of radiation the body absorbs for each kilogram
679	00:42:02.390	00:42:05.720	of weight. Although no one really knows what level is
680	00:42:05.730	00:42:09.410	safe, for now the Federal Communications Commission has set a
681	00:42:09.420	00:42:14.820	maximum SAR of 1.6 for cell phones. You can determine
682	00:42:14.830	00:42:18.310	your phone's rating by locating its FCC ID number on
683	00:42:18.320	00:42:21.180	the back, and then looking up the matching SAR on
684	00:42:21.190	00:42:25.670	the FCC Internet page. People worried about cell phone safety
685	00:42:25.680	00:42:29.110	can also take precautions. One is to avoid using a
686	00:42:29.120	00:42:32.800	cellphone inside a building or wherever the signal is weak,
687	00:42:32.810	00:42:36.260	since this requires the phone to emit more radiation. Cell
688	00:42:36.270	00:42:39.890	phone users can also get external antennas for their cars,
689	00:42:39.900	00:42:43.300	or use portable, hands-free headsets like this one with the
690	00:42:43.310	00:42:46.590	phone held as far as possible away from the body.
691	00:42:46.600	00:42:48.850	And some experts say it makes sense for now to
692	00:42:48.860	00:42:52.820	avoid long cell phone chats--at least until more cell
693	00:42:52.830	00:43:04.720	phone safety research produces more definitive results in the future.
694	00:43:04.730	00:43:08.030	Finally tonight, some historical perspective on the year 2000 and
695	00:43:08.040	00:43:12.170	to Elizabeth Farnsworth. We look back at this year with
696	00:43:12.180	00:43:16.800	NewsHour regulars Presidential Historian Michael Beschloss and Journalist and Author
697	00:43:16.810	00:43:20.790	Haynes Johnson. Joining them are Presidential Biographer and Historian Richard
698	00:43:20.800	00:43:25.420	Norton Smith, and Historian Roger Wilkins of George Mason University.
699	00:43:25.430	00:43:28.460	Richard, from a historical point of view, what was significant
700	00:43:28.470	00:43:33.460	about this past year? Well, of course I'm tempted to
701	00:43:33.470	00:43:35.790	answer the election. It was certainly the most memorable event
702	00:43:35.800	00:43:38.810	of the year, although in an odd kind of way,
703	00:43:38.820	00:43:40.600	it wasn't the election so much as what followed the
704	00:43:40.610	00:43:44.560	election. But in fact, we won't know for several years
705	00:43:44.570	00:43:48.150	whether the election of 2000 is the most historically significant
706	00:43:48.160	00:43:52.310	or influential event. One thing we know happened this past
707	00:43:52.320	00:43:55.980	year that will cast a very long shadow for centuries
708	00:43:55.990	00:43:58.700	to come and that was the mapping of the human
709	00:43:58.710	00:44:02.610	genetic code, which, by the way, ultimately will also affect
710	00:44:02.620	00:44:05.790	our politics because, as we get closer to a culture
711	00:44:05.800	00:44:08.790	of man-made man, there are bound to be a host
712	00:44:08.800	00:44:13.140	of ethical, spiritual, moral and, yes, political issues, some of
713	00:44:13.150	00:44:15.970	which could make the current controversy over abortion look relatively
714	00:44:15.980	00:44:19.610	tame. Haynes, do you have another choice for the most
715	00:44:19.620	00:44:22.150	significant event of the year? Well, it's weird because we
716	00:44:22.160	00:44:24.090	haven't precast this at all. We never know what we're
717	00:44:24.100	00:44:26.230	going to say to each other--but that's exactly what
718	00:44:26.240	00:44:29.150	I would say. If you're in Washington, incestuous as it
719	00:44:29.160	00:44:32.000	is, you'd say the election. But I don't think that's
720	00:44:32.010	00:44:34.660	the most important thing. I think we might look back
721	00:44:34.670	00:44:36.940	on this time and say this was the year in
722	00:44:36.950	00:44:40.840	which the boom seemed to end, when the bubble was
723	00:44:40.850	00:44:44.530	in danger of bursting, affecting the long-term economy. But I
724	00:44:44.540	00:44:48.660	think overshadowing that, I agree with Richard, the long-term implications
725	00:44:48.670	00:44:51.580	of this stunning advancement in genetics, which is going to
726	00:44:51.590	00:44:54.710	change everything in life and affect us profoundly in the
727	00:44:54.720	00:44:57.570	future. And, Roger, even though you've lost a wisdom tooth,
728	00:44:57.580	00:44:59.330	do you still have enough wisdom to come up with
729	00:44:59.340	00:45:01.830	an answer to this question? Well, since it almost all
730	00:45:01.840	00:45:05.550	leaked out, I would say that the thing that concerns
731	00:45:05.560	00:45:10.000	me most is the incredible meltdown of the $100 million
732	00:45:10.010	00:45:19.280	Washington football team. Really? But beyond that, I have been
733	00:45:19.290	00:45:25.230	terribly troubled by the renewal of the hostilities in Israel
734	00:45:25.240	00:45:28.210	and the war between the Palestinians and the Israelis. You
735	00:45:28.220	00:45:30.790	know, when I was in high school out there in
736	00:45:30.800	00:45:37.040	Grand Rapids where Richard is, Ralph Bunt was negotiating a
737	00:45:37.050	00:45:39.930	truce between the Palestinians and the Israelis, and we were
738	00:45:39.940	00:45:43.400	thinking that it was going to last forever, that the
739	00:45:43.410	00:45:48.240	U.N. would monitor it, there would be peace. And every
740	00:45:48.250	00:45:54.110	time you seem to touch the peace, you find a
741	00:45:54.120	00:45:59.540	truth, that the haters control the veto button. And every
742	00:45:59.550	00:46:03.890	time you almost get peace, it explodes. And I think
743	00:46:03.900	00:46:07.230	that that tells us something really profound, not just about
744	00:46:07.240	00:46:09.530	the Middle East, but about ourselves as human beings, that
745	00:46:09.540	00:46:15.080	we horde our grievances and occasionally they explode. Michael Beschloss,
746	00:46:15.090	00:46:17.280	what do you say is the most significant event of
747	00:46:17.290	00:46:19.150	the year? Well, you know what? While I'm listening to
748	00:46:19.160	00:46:21.760	all this, Elizabeth, it reminds me of something, which is
749	00:46:21.770	00:46:25.190	that in the 1960s, when John Kennedy suggested that we
750	00:46:25.200	00:46:28.090	Americans land a person--he said a man on the
751	00:46:28.100	00:46:31.030	Moon by 1970, a lot of people said, "you know,
752	00:46:31.040	00:46:34.430	$20 billion to land a man on the Moon, it
753	00:46:34.440	00:46:37.360	was really in many ways a waste of money." But
754	00:46:37.370	00:46:39.660	you know, that was the view that people had from
755	00:46:39.670	00:46:42.680	that perspective. Many people think, and I think it's very
756	00:46:42.690	00:46:46.710	possible, that 500 years from now, we may look back--
757	00:46:46.720	00:46:48.970	it won't be any of us, unfortunately--but people might
758	00:46:48.980	00:46:52.010	look back on the 20th century and say that a
759	00:46:52.020	00:46:54.630	human being on the Moon was the most important thing,
760	00:46:54.640	00:46:57.850	or one of them, that human beings did. But since
761	00:46:57.860	00:47:01.470	we're dealing only with a more limited perspective tonight, I'd
762	00:47:01.480	00:47:04.530	say the election of 2000 in one sense, and that
763	00:47:04.540	00:47:08.220	is that this is the first election since 1928 where,
764	00:47:08.230	00:47:11.130	thank God, we were not electing a President under the
765	00:47:11.140	00:47:14.370	shadow of an international emergency, like the Cold War or
766	00:47:14.380	00:47:17.710	World War II or an economic crisis like the recession
767	00:47:17.720	00:47:21.400	even of 1992, and that's a wonderful thing. But the
768	00:47:21.410	00:47:25.320	downside of that is that it makes presidents less powerful.
769	00:47:25.330	00:47:27.440	We're at the end of the period that Arthur Schlessinger
770	00:47:27.450	00:47:30.750	called, the imperial presidency, and I think as the first
771	00:47:30.760	00:47:34.180	post-imperial president, George W. Bush has his work cut out
772	00:47:34.190	00:47:37.580	for him. Richard, respond to that. And also, what in
773	00:47:37.590	00:47:41.070	the elections can you say now will be most lasting?
774	00:47:41.080	00:47:44.470	What about the process or the way it was covered?
775	00:47:44.480	00:47:47.160	Well, that's a great question, Elizabeth, because I was going
776	00:47:47.170	00:47:50.070	to say the non-story of the year is a wonderful
777	00:47:50.080	00:47:53.040	subtext for the election and the way we covered the
778	00:47:53.050	00:47:57.640	election. Remember Y2K and doomsday? Well, it never happened. What
779	00:47:57.650	00:48:01.260	happened was hype. And hype has infested not only the
780	00:48:01.270	00:48:05.650	popular culture; in many ways, it's also infected the way
781	00:48:05.660	00:48:09.010	we cover our democracy itself. We've known for a long
782	00:48:09.020	00:48:10.860	time that politics has been looked at as a horse
783	00:48:10.870	00:48:13.890	race, that's fine. This year it seems to me was
784	00:48:13.900	00:48:16.150	the first election in which we paid less attention to
785	00:48:16.160	00:48:19.560	the horses than we did to the handicappers, to the
786	00:48:19.570	00:48:22.190	spin doctors and the focus groups and all of the
787	00:48:22.200	00:48:24.960	special pleaders who shouted at each other as if you
788	00:48:24.970	00:48:29.070	test democracy by decibel level. I think that's worrisome. I
789	00:48:29.080	00:48:32.340	think there's a trivialization, I think there's an element of
790	00:48:32.350	00:48:36.510	the media which are interested in conflict over conflict resolution.
791	00:48:36.520	00:48:39.390	And in many ways the legitimate media, the mainstream media,
792	00:48:39.400	00:48:44.570	are beginning to take their message from the fringe. I
793	00:48:44.580	00:48:47.900	mean the NewsHour is a wonderful oasis. My concern is
794	00:48:47.910	00:48:50.790	that the desert is getting bigger. Haynes, when you look
795	00:48:50.800	00:48:53.370	at the elections and all of this past year's politics,
796	00:48:53.380	00:48:55.970	what do you see that's most lasting? Well, I think
797	00:48:55.980	00:48:58.170	that certainly it's true about the media, but that's a
798	00:48:58.180	00:49:01.240	long-term process. It's not new. We have been going through
799	00:49:01.250	00:49:04.440	this cycle after cycle. It does increase. It's serious, and
800	00:49:04.450	00:49:07.230	it's troubling. But I think what this election really told
801	00:49:07.240	00:49:11.390	us was that the system fundamentally wasn't working at the
802	00:49:11.400	00:49:14.640	very grassroots of democracy. Now, it worked in the sense
803	00:49:14.650	00:49:17.100	we talked on this show before, and that we all
804	00:49:17.110	00:49:19.780	got a lesson in what our system is, its strengths,
805	00:49:19.790	00:49:22.020	and the strengths are manifold. But it also--we got
806	00:49:22.030	00:49:24.800	a lesson that there were fundamental ways in which we
807	00:49:24.810	00:49:27.740	don't vote equitably. The more we learn about how the
808	00:49:27.750	00:49:30.930	votes were counted, it's a real challenge on not just
809	00:49:30.940	00:49:33.640	the new administration--on the entire society, to make it
810	00:49:33.650	00:49:35.980	fair. That's the essence of democracy. And that if you
811	00:49:35.990	00:49:38.210	don't believe in it to be fair, then I think
812	00:49:38.220	00:49:41.650	you have a serious long-term problem. Roger Wilkins, your last
813	00:49:41.660	00:49:44.070	remarks made me think that your looking at this past
814	00:49:44.080	00:49:49.090	year is confirming a somewhat not negative but not optimistic
815	00:49:49.100	00:49:52.830	view of human nature. Well, yes, and I saw part
816	00:49:52.840	00:49:55.620	of that in the election. I would say two good
817	00:49:55.630	00:49:59.460	things happened in elections: Mexico got a new president and
818	00:49:59.470	00:50:02.000	got rid of the old party that had been in
819	00:50:02.010	00:50:07.140	power for 70 or 80 years; and Slobodan Milosevic is
820	00:50:07.150	00:50:09.390	halfway off the stage. Both of those are to the
821	00:50:09.400	00:50:14.040	good. But the part of our election that really troubled
822	00:50:14.050	00:50:21.920	me was the dubious integrity of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence.
823	00:50:21.930	00:50:28.090	You go back...it is hard to look at that
824	00:50:28.100	00:50:35.650	five-person majority's judgment and not conclude with Justice Stevens that
825	00:50:35.660	00:50:39.570	one thing is certain, that the integrity of the judicial
826	00:50:39.580	00:50:43.260	process has been hurt here. And I haven't seen a
827	00:50:43.270	00:50:52.030	decision which seemed so devoid of jurisprudential integrity since the
828	00:50:52.040	00:50:57.590	old post-Civil War Supreme Court decisions which tried to slam
829	00:50:57.600	00:51:03.950	blacks back into semi-slavery. So I would say that this
830	00:51:03.960	00:51:10.210	judicial intrusion into the electoral process was deeply troubling. Richard,
831	00:51:10.220	00:51:12.290	before we move off the politics, you want to respond
832	00:51:12.300	00:51:16.160	to that? Well, I certainly respect Roger's viewpoint. I think
833	00:51:16.170	00:51:18.910	the other perspective might be that the court saved the
834	00:51:18.920	00:51:24.100	country from another month of what was rapidly escalating polarization
835	00:51:24.110	00:51:27.380	with the likely same result, two sets of election returns
836	00:51:27.390	00:51:31.490	perhaps going to Washington, having a deeply divided Congress, possibly
837	00:51:31.500	00:51:35.140	even having Al Gore himself cast the deciding vote. I'm
838	00:51:35.150	00:51:38.310	not sure if that would have been much worse. Michael,
839	00:51:38.320	00:51:40.410	before we...actually, I want to move on to foreign
840	00:51:40.420	00:51:42.890	affairs now. You heard what Roger said about the Middle
841	00:51:42.900	00:51:46.070	East. What would you consider most significant in what happened
842	00:51:46.080	00:51:49.690	outside of this country? Well, one thing was last March
843	00:51:49.700	00:51:52.590	we saw for the first time in a millennium, a
844	00:51:52.600	00:51:57.060	democratic transfer of power in Russia to Vladimir Putin, who
845	00:51:57.070	00:52:00.040	was elected to a four-year term as president, which is
846	00:52:00.050	00:52:03.320	a wonderful thing, exactly what many of us Americans had
847	00:52:03.330	00:52:05.540	been dreaming of all through the Cold War. This is
848	00:52:05.550	00:52:07.710	the kind of system that we wanted to see in
849	00:52:07.720	00:52:10.180	Russia. But at the same time, this is a Putin
850	00:52:10.190	00:52:12.910	who's going to be much tougher for a new American
851	00:52:12.920	00:52:16.690	administration than was Boris Yeltsin, someone who wants to make
852	00:52:16.700	00:52:22.000	Russia strong, possibly conceivably an economic rival, military rival, political
853	00:52:22.010	00:52:25.040	rival to the United States. And the result is that
854	00:52:25.050	00:52:29.210	I think we may see that Putin's ascendancy is the
855	00:52:29.220	00:52:31.330	end of this odd period of the last eight or
856	00:52:31.340	00:52:34.410	nine years where Americans were not very interested in foreign
857	00:52:34.420	00:52:37.470	affairs and nor were presidents. And Haynes, what's your choice
858	00:52:37.480	00:52:40.960	for a foreign story? I think the Middle East, as
859	00:52:40.970	00:52:43.510	Roger said earlier. I think it's not that it's a
860	00:52:43.520	00:52:46.470	new story. Obviously, it's thousands of years old. And the
861	00:52:46.480	00:52:49.550	trouble is it keeps sinking in the same morass, and
862	00:52:49.560	00:52:51.780	it never seems...you keep coming up with the hope
863	00:52:51.790	00:52:54.570	that something's going to happen, and it is a testament--
864	00:52:54.580	00:52:57.780	and Roger said it better than I can--to man's
865	00:52:57.790	00:52:59.780	inhumanity to man. We just don't seem to be able
866	00:52:59.790	00:53:01.770	to get it together at the last minute when we
867	00:53:01.780	00:53:03.760	need to, and I think that's the thing that's most
868	00:53:03.770	00:53:07.860	depressing. Russia is a serious question on the world horizon,
869	00:53:07.870	00:53:10.830	if it's falling apart. And I think I'd also add
870	00:53:10.840	00:53:13.580	that China's emergence is going to be looked at in
871	00:53:13.590	00:53:16.670	years to come as a great story. And, Roger, anything
872	00:53:16.680	00:53:19.350	else you want to add about foreign stories? Oh, yeah.
873	00:53:19.360	00:53:23.520	It's that we finally understand how devastating AIDS in Africa
874	00:53:23.530	00:53:26.530	is, and we're looking at the rest of the world
875	00:53:26.540	00:53:30.840	and saying, "can we muster"..."We've got the money, we've
876	00:53:30.850	00:53:36.070	got the technology, can we muster the humanity to help?"
877	00:53:36.080	00:53:39.460	That's the story for last year and the issue for
878	00:53:39.470	00:53:43.800	this coming year. Richard, your foreign story? Well, you know,
879	00:53:43.810	00:53:47.620	it's interesting. Roger mentioned Vicente Fox, whose election in itself
880	00:53:47.630	00:53:50.920	is a real landmark for hemispheric democracy and a cause
881	00:53:50.930	00:53:54.210	for celebration. And if he succeeds, that success will have
882	00:53:54.220	00:53:57.630	real implications for this country, as well. He is just
883	00:53:57.640	00:54:00.010	starting his career on the world stage. Let me pick
884	00:54:00.020	00:54:02.380	as a man of the year a man who is
885	00:54:02.390	00:54:04.130	clearly near the end of his time on the world
886	00:54:04.140	00:54:06.770	stage, and that's the Pope. This year of course was
887	00:54:06.780	00:54:09.660	the holy year in the Catholic Church, highlighted by a
888	00:54:09.670	00:54:12.510	very emotional pilgrimage to the Middle East. This is a
889	00:54:12.520	00:54:14.630	man who, after 22 years on the throne of St.
890	00:54:14.640	00:54:19.340	Peter, clearly a man of diminished strength but undiminished moral
891	00:54:19.350	00:54:24.780	stature, continues really to tower over his contemporaries. And because
892	00:54:24.790	00:54:29.330	he confronted successfully almost every kind of evil that human
893	00:54:29.340	00:54:32.760	kind or technology could conjure up in the old century,
894	00:54:32.770	00:54:34.550	I think he'll continue to be an influence well into
895	00:54:34.560	00:54:36.570	the new one. And Michael, we have very little time
896	00:54:36.580	00:54:38.490	left, but the rest of you, please tell me who
897	00:54:38.500	00:54:41.740	you'd have as your man or woman of the year.
898	00:54:41.750	00:54:44.280	I think you can't do better than the Holy Father.
899	00:54:44.290	00:54:47.190	And George Bush of course was on the cover of
900	00:54:47.200	00:54:50.560	a news magazine named "Time" this past year. The interesting
901	00:54:50.570	00:54:53.850	thing is that this election was so divided--we were
902	00:54:53.860	00:54:56.850	this year, that that was sort of a close call.
903	00:54:56.860	00:54:58.850	And, Roger, man or woman of the year? Oh, I
904	00:54:58.860	00:55:01.830	wouldn't descent from Richard's choice, but if I had to
905	00:55:01.840	00:55:05.670	pick a second one, it would be Tiger Woods. Haynes,
906	00:55:05.680	00:55:07.920	who's your choice? Well, would I add someone we haven't
907	00:55:07.930	00:55:10.570	talked about, Craig Ventner, who was the person who led
908	00:55:10.580	00:55:12.970	the breaking of a genetic code, mapping of the human
909	00:55:12.980	00:55:14.980	life that's going to change us so much. In the
910	00:55:14.990	00:55:17.410	long run, he may be the most influential in the
911	00:55:17.420	00:55:29.200	future. Well, Happy New Year to all of you. Thanks.
912	00:55:29.210	00:55:32.910	Again, the major stories of this Thursday, President-elect Bush nominated
913	00:55:32.920	00:55:36.320	Donald Rumsfeld for defense secretary. And the first data from
914	00:55:36.330	00:55:39.560	the year 2000 Census show the U.S. population has jumped
915	00:55:39.570	00:55:44.130	more than 13% since 1990, to more than 281 million
916	00:55:44.140	00:55:47.770	people. We'll see you online and again here tomorrow evening
917	00:55:47.780	00:55:51.020	with Shields and Brooks, among others. I'm Margaret Warner. Thanks
918	00:55:51.030	01:04:11.836	for being with us. Good night.
