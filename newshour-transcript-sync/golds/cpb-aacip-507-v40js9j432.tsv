1	00:02:01.890	00:02:05.270	Good evening. These were the top headline stories today. President
2	00:02:05.280	00:02:08.450	Reagan considered ways to increase the pressure on the captors
3	00:02:08.460	00:02:12.840	of 40 American hostages, including a blockade of Lebanon. Syria
4	00:02:12.850	00:02:15.810	and Israel offered to help in the crisis. House and
5	00:02:15.820	00:02:19.180	Senate negotiators gave up efforts to reach a compromise agreement
6	00:02:19.190	00:02:22.770	on a budget to reduce the deficit. An Oklahoma fireworks
7	00:02:22.780	00:02:27.530	plant exploded, killing at least 21. Jim? The NewsHour tonight
8	00:02:27.540	00:02:29.870	is the news of the day, two focus segments and
9	00:02:29.880	00:02:34.520	a newsmaker interview. Focus one, President Reagan's options against Lebanon,
10	00:02:34.530	00:02:38.090	first with Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Richard Lugar, then
11	00:02:38.100	00:02:42.060	with Jesse Jackson, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and former
12	00:02:42.070	00:02:45.810	State Department official Joseph Sisco. Focus two, the falling out
13	00:02:45.820	00:02:48.850	of House and Senate conferees over the budget, with two
14	00:02:48.860	00:02:52.070	of the principal players, Congressman William Gray and Senator William
15	00:02:52.080	00:02:56.270	Armstrong. The newsmaker interview is with Senator Robert Packwood, chairman
16	00:02:56.280	00:02:58.550	of the Senate Finance Committee and a key man in
17	00:02:58.560	00:03:21.260	the move for tax reform. President Reagan has decided to let
18	00:03:21.270	00:03:24.200	diplomacy work a while longer to free the 40 American
19	00:03:24.210	00:03:27.710	hostages in Beirut. White House spokesman Larry Speakes said late
20	00:03:27.720	00:03:31.660	today the President is considering several concrete options, but decided
21	00:03:31.670	00:03:34.750	to hold back to see if diplomatic efforts will work.
22	00:03:34.760	00:03:37.530	Speakes said the options include shutting down the flow of
23	00:03:37.540	00:03:41.470	goods and services into Lebanon through boycotts and other economic
24	00:03:41.480	00:03:45.530	measures, and closing down Beirut airport to all traffic. Both
25	00:03:45.540	00:03:48.490	of these steps, he said, would require cooperation of other
26	00:03:48.500	00:03:50.520	countries; the point of it all would be to put
27	00:03:50.530	00:03:54.160	pressure on the Shiite Moslems to release the hostages. Mr.
28	00:03:54.170	00:03:58.320	Reagan met today with his top diplomatic, military and intelligence
29	00:03:58.330	00:04:03.120	advisers, including Secretary of State Shultz and Defense Secretary Weinberger.
30	00:04:03.130	00:04:06.240	Robin? There were these other developments in the hostage crisis
31	00:04:06.250	00:04:09.710	today. White House spokesman Speakes said Syria had agreed to
32	00:04:09.720	00:04:13.230	help, but Washington had seen no evidence of it. Israel's
33	00:04:13.240	00:04:16.350	Prime Minister Shimon Peres sent a letter to President Reagan
34	00:04:16.360	00:04:20.650	pledging full cooperation. Previously Israel has expressed sympathy, but said
35	00:04:20.660	00:04:25.580	the situation is an American affair. United Nations Secretary-General Javier
36	00:04:25.590	00:04:28.750	Perez de Cuellar issued a statement calling for the early
37	00:04:28.760	00:04:33.930	release of the 735 Lebanese prisoners still held by Israel.
38	00:04:33.940	00:04:37.030	The International Red Cross says it was visiting all 40
39	00:04:37.040	00:04:40.760	hostages today in Beirut. We will take a long look
40	00:04:40.770	00:04:44.560	at the hostage situation in our lead focus segment tonight.
41	00:04:44.570	00:04:47.190	In El Salvador today there was a follow-up to last
42	00:04:47.200	00:04:50.510	week's killing of four U.S. Marines. A leftist guerrilla group
43	00:04:50.520	00:04:53.130	said the raid was only the beginning of a war
44	00:04:53.140	00:04:57.110	against American servicemen in El Salvador. The off-duty Marines had
45	00:04:57.120	00:05:00.040	been assigned to the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador. They
46	00:05:00.050	00:05:04.330	were shot while eating at an outdoor cafe. House and
47	00:05:04.340	00:05:07.790	Senate conferees today gave up for the time being their
48	00:05:07.800	00:05:10.750	efforts to find a compromise budget to cut the federal
49	00:05:10.760	00:05:14.760	deficit. They were unable to reconcile differences between the Republican
50	00:05:14.770	00:05:19.420	Senate budget plan, which cuts Social Security cost-of-living increases, and
51	00:05:19.430	00:05:22.990	the Democratic House plan, which leaves the COLAs intact, but
52	00:05:23.000	00:05:26.770	makes deeper cuts in defense. The impasse was described by
53	00:05:26.780	00:05:34.230	Senate Budget Committee chairman Pete Domenici. I have concluded that
54	00:05:34.240	00:05:39.560	no good purpose can be served in continuing this conference
55	00:05:39.570	00:05:43.730	at this time. Knowing full well the importance of a
56	00:05:43.740	00:05:49.550	major deficit reduction package, I have, nonetheless, concluded that we
57	00:05:49.560	00:05:53.400	should no longer proceed. I don't want this to be
58	00:05:53.410	00:05:59.120	interpreted in any way that the House conferees, and in
59	00:05:59.130	00:06:02.960	particular the distinguished chairman of the House conference, have not
60	00:06:02.970	00:06:06.750	tried their very best. It's just one of those situation
61	00:06:06.760	00:06:10.710	where now that, consistent with the confines of these two
62	00:06:10.720	00:06:14.200	budget resolutions, there seems to the senator from New Mexico,
63	00:06:14.210	00:06:17.020	chairman of this conference and the chairman of the Senate
64	00:06:17.030	00:06:21.150	conferees, that no useful purpose will be served, with the
65	00:06:21.160	00:06:25.170	situation being what it is, for us to proceed. We'll
66	00:06:25.180	00:06:28.000	discuss the budget deadlock in a focus section later in
67	00:06:28.010	00:06:30.740	the program when we also have a newsmaker interview on
68	00:06:30.750	00:06:33.730	the shape of tax reform with Senate Finance Committee chairman
69	00:06:33.740	00:06:37.520	Robert Packwood. More than 20 people died today in a
70	00:06:37.530	00:06:41.530	series of explosions at an Oklahoma fireworks factory. Thirty-one people
71	00:06:41.540	00:06:44.490	were in the factory's five buildings at the time; three
72	00:06:44.500	00:06:47.610	of the five buildings were demolished. There was no immediate
73	00:06:47.620	00:06:50.600	word on the cause of the explosions, which were felt
74	00:06:50.610	00:06:54.570	nearly 15 miles away. An Oklahoma highway patrolman described the
75	00:06:54.580	00:06:57.590	scene. We found bodies out into the woods and what
76	00:06:57.600	00:06:59.760	have you, so it was a massive explosion. We still
77	00:06:59.770	00:07:02.490	have some magazines over the hill that are still live
78	00:07:02.500	00:07:05.060	and are capable of going off. We have the fire
79	00:07:05.070	00:07:08.030	department here and the sheriff's helping us and we've got
80	00:07:08.040	00:07:09.980	other towns around that are helping us secure the area
81	00:07:09.990	00:07:11.990	so we can make sure it is safe. Lieutenant King,
82	00:07:12.000	00:07:14.100	didn't this same place blow up about six years ago?
83	00:07:14.110	00:07:16.820	Yes, sir, it did. Same company? Yes, sir, as far
84	00:07:16.830	00:07:20.750	as I know. The fireworks company is named the Aerlex
85	00:07:20.760	00:07:24.400	Corporation. Their factory is near Hallett, Oklahoma, a town of
86	00:07:24.410	00:07:28.170	200, 40 miles west of Tulsa. And the situation in
87	00:07:28.180	00:07:32.440	Anaheim, California, has turned more dangerous. Toxic fumes have been
88	00:07:32.450	00:07:36.460	pouring from an agriculture warehouse fire there since Saturday. Ten
89	00:07:36.470	00:07:39.670	people, including one fireman, have been treated for injuries, and
90	00:07:39.680	00:07:44.320	9,000 people have evacuated their homes in the area. Spokesmen
91	00:07:44.330	00:07:47.930	said potentially explosive chemicals remain in the warehouse. Here is
92	00:07:47.940	00:07:51.020	a further report by Marika Gerard of L.A. News, an
93	00:07:51.030	00:07:56.760	independent service. The fire started late Saturday night in the
94	00:07:56.770	00:08:00.250	Larry Fricker Company, a pesticide and herbicide warehouse in Orange
95	00:08:00.260	00:08:04.720	County. Because of the potential danger from toxic fumes, 2,000
96	00:08:04.730	00:08:08.010	people were initially asked to leave nearby homes while firefighters
97	00:08:08.020	00:08:11.930	fought the blaze. However, by Monday, as the chemicals continued
98	00:08:11.940	00:08:16.580	to smoulder, the evacuation area was doubled. Firefighters first thought
99	00:08:16.590	00:08:19.780	they were dealing with only a few potentially dangerous chemicals,
100	00:08:19.790	00:08:22.120	but now believe there may be as many as 80
101	00:08:22.130	00:08:25.900	chemicals housed in the building, including highly flammable ammonium sulfate
102	00:08:25.910	00:08:29.520	and ammonium nitrate compounds. So far there have been no
103	00:08:29.530	00:08:32.860	serious injuries as a result of the fire. Although many
104	00:08:32.870	00:08:35.710	evacuees have complained of sore throats and itchy eyes, very
105	00:08:35.720	00:08:39.010	few have been treated. Today an extra U.S. Coast Guard
106	00:08:39.020	00:08:41.570	strike team has arrived from San Francisco to help county
107	00:08:41.580	00:08:45.920	firefighters neutralize the smouldering chemicals. Officials say it could be
108	00:08:45.930	00:08:48.880	as many as two or three days before evacuated residents
109	00:08:48.890	00:08:52.770	will be allowed back in their homes. Investigators said today
110	00:08:52.780	00:08:55.420	that wreckage from the Air India plane which crashed on
111	00:08:55.430	00:08:58.790	Sunday showed the 747 broke up in the air, but
112	00:08:58.800	00:09:00.580	it was too early to say if it was blown
113	00:09:00.590	00:09:04.260	up. Meanwhile, searchers scaled down the hunt for bodies. Of
114	00:09:04.270	00:09:07.880	the 329 people aboard, the bodies of 131 have been
115	00:09:07.890	00:09:10.850	recovered from the Atlantic west of Ireland. Here's a report
116	00:09:10.860	00:09:15.580	from Kate Adie of Visnews. The intensive air search over,
117	00:09:15.590	00:09:18.550	helicopters have been on standby to help with the more
118	00:09:18.560	00:09:22.790	specialized hunt for the flight recorder. Early today a Chinook
119	00:09:22.800	00:09:26.680	headed out to sea carrying technical and electronics personnel who
120	00:09:26.690	00:09:29.510	will be attempting to wrest some information from below the
121	00:09:29.520	00:09:34.450	sea's surface. The Royal Navy's Challenger took them on board,
122	00:09:34.460	00:09:37.190	but she's now patrolling in an area with only a
123	00:09:37.200	00:09:42.140	few hints of the jumbo visible occasionally. The Irish have
124	00:09:42.150	00:09:46.630	fishery protection vessels crisscrossing the designated area, and there's still
125	00:09:46.640	00:09:49.630	more equipment being brought in for what has to be
126	00:09:49.640	00:09:52.520	a very long shot at discovering the relevant part of
127	00:09:52.530	00:10:00.840	the plane. No bodies have been located for over 24
128	00:10:00.850	00:10:03.920	hours, and the sea will have dispersed the wreckage to
129	00:10:03.930	00:10:06.680	an extent that the Irish authorities have asked for a
130	00:10:06.690	00:10:09.850	lookout to be kept on the shores of Britain, France
131	00:10:09.860	00:10:14.280	and even Spain. Air India suspended service to Canada, where
132	00:10:14.290	00:10:18.960	the doomed flight originated, demanding tighter airport security there. Authorities
133	00:10:18.970	00:10:23.110	in India, Japan, Canada and Britain are investigating two Sikh
134	00:10:23.120	00:10:26.840	fugitives who might be linked with the Air India disaster
135	00:10:26.850	00:10:29.880	and a bomb explosion at Tokyo airport. The bomb was
136	00:10:29.890	00:10:32.720	in luggage which had arrived on a Canadian Pacific plane
137	00:10:32.730	00:10:36.620	from Vancouver. Two Sikhs, Lal Singh and Ammand Singh, booked
138	00:10:36.630	00:10:40.370	tickets on that flight to Tokyo. One canceled his booking.
139	00:10:40.380	00:10:42.240	Two men of the same name are wanted in the
140	00:10:42.250	00:10:45.440	United States on charges of plotting to assassinate Indian Prime
141	00:10:45.450	00:10:50.670	Minister Rajiv Gandhi. The U.S. Transportation Department is sending President
142	00:10:50.680	00:10:53.420	Reagan a list of ways to improve airline security in
143	00:10:53.430	00:10:56.780	this country. A department spokesman said the list includes placing
144	00:10:56.790	00:11:00.810	armed air marshals aboard planes flying the most threatened routes,
145	00:11:00.820	00:11:05.120	better anti-terrorist training for airline crews, and accelerated research and
146	00:11:05.130	00:11:09.210	development of explosive detection devices. White House spokesman Larry Speakes
147	00:11:09.220	00:11:13.600	said he thought the President would certainly approve the measures.
148	00:11:13.610	00:11:16.740	In economic news today Japan announced it was cutting or
149	00:11:16.750	00:11:20.340	ending import tariffs on more than eighteen hundred items, and
150	00:11:20.350	00:11:23.890	promised more measures next month. Prime Minister Nakasone, who has
151	00:11:23.900	00:11:27.650	urged greater Japanese imports to lessen the huge trade imbalance,
152	00:11:27.660	00:11:31.520	particularly with this country, commented, "I hope foreign governments appreciate
153	00:11:31.530	00:11:35.240	our efforts." The U.S. government reported today that orders for
154	00:11:35.250	00:11:40.170	large manufactured goods rose 4.1 percent in May, propelled mainly
155	00:11:40.180	00:11:43.500	by a big increase in orders for military hardware. Commerce
156	00:11:43.510	00:11:46.850	Secretary Baldrige said the gain offsets most of the recent
157	00:11:46.860	00:11:51.550	setbacks. And IBM, the world's biggest computer company, said it's
158	00:11:51.560	00:12:08.350	buying a 30 percent share of MCI Communications. We look
159	00:12:08.360	00:12:11.730	first tonight at the latest in the TWA hostage crisis,
160	00:12:11.740	00:12:14.840	now in its 12th day. President Reagan, said his spokesman,
161	00:12:14.850	00:12:18.940	Larry Speakes, late this afternoon, is considering several options aimed
162	00:12:18.950	00:12:21.950	at freeing the 40 Americans being held by Shiite Moslem
163	00:12:21.960	00:12:25.220	terrorists. Those actions include trying to close down the Beirut
164	00:12:25.230	00:12:28.540	airport to all air traffic and an economic boycott of
165	00:12:28.550	00:12:31.980	Lebanon. Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana and chairman of
166	00:12:31.990	00:12:35.470	the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was extensively briefed by Secretary
167	00:12:35.480	00:12:38.490	of State Shultz on the options available to the President.
168	00:12:38.500	00:12:40.670	He met at the White House today with President Reagan
169	00:12:40.680	00:12:44.310	as well. Senator Lugar, why the decision to hold back
170	00:12:44.320	00:12:48.200	for now? Well, I think that we are still involved
171	00:12:48.210	00:12:52.170	essentially in the negotiation mode. We're working with other countries
172	00:12:52.180	00:12:55.050	that are friendly, some that are perhaps not so friendly.
173	00:12:55.060	00:12:59.180	We attempt to explore with Israel all the ways we
174	00:12:59.190	00:13:03.420	can cooperate with that very friendly government. There are a
175	00:13:03.430	00:13:05.940	lot of options the President could adopt, and I think
176	00:13:05.950	00:13:09.860	this was a good day for sharing with congressional leadership
177	00:13:09.870	00:13:13.940	and with others how we might proceed. Is one of
178	00:13:13.950	00:13:19.290	the key diplomatic options being pursued is a way to
179	00:13:19.300	00:13:22.670	get Israel to release the seven hundred Shiites they're holding?
180	00:13:22.680	00:13:25.010	No, our position remains the same, and I think it
181	00:13:25.020	00:13:29.550	needs to be insistently commented on. We're not going to
182	00:13:29.560	00:13:34.030	negotiate with terrorists, we're not going to insist that Israel
183	00:13:34.040	00:13:38.730	bow to terrorists. The prime minister of Israel, Shimon Peres,
184	00:13:38.740	00:13:43.600	pointed out in interviews on Sunday that eight different hijackings
185	00:13:43.610	00:13:47.370	have already afflicted Israel. He has been involved in negotiating
186	00:13:47.380	00:13:50.090	for the release of Israelis three times. He's an old
187	00:13:50.100	00:13:52.800	hand at this type of experience. He's in good touch
188	00:13:52.810	00:13:56.520	with George Shultz, our secretary of state, and our ties
189	00:13:56.530	00:14:00.080	are of that nature, not ones of pressure. Well, then
190	00:14:00.090	00:14:02.770	what kind of negotiation--what is there to negotiate about
191	00:14:02.780	00:14:07.690	and with whom? Well, we believe that the predicament of
192	00:14:07.700	00:14:11.520	those who are holding our hostages is not necessarily secure.
193	00:14:11.530	00:14:15.210	We think that there are potential arguments or pressures that
194	00:14:15.220	00:14:17.140	could be brought to bear that would make a difference
195	00:14:17.150	00:14:20.860	for them. We're attempting to explore each one of those
196	00:14:20.870	00:14:23.900	and it seems to me that the impression that everyone
197	00:14:23.910	00:14:26.630	ought to have, they ought to have correctly, is that
198	00:14:26.640	00:14:29.260	this President is at his post, so is the secretary
199	00:14:29.270	00:14:32.120	of state, Mr. McFarlane and the others, in good touch
200	00:14:32.130	00:14:35.800	with congressional supporters and, as a matter of fact, in
201	00:14:35.810	00:14:40.840	a bipartisan sense with the leadership. And we're prepared steadily,
202	00:14:40.850	00:14:44.220	day after day, to explore every option. Well, Senator, you
203	00:14:44.230	00:14:46.840	probably know more than anybody in the Congress right now
204	00:14:46.850	00:14:50.120	as we speak about what is going on. Do you
205	00:14:50.130	00:14:53.970	have any particular reason to be optimistic? Oh, I'm always
206	00:14:53.980	00:14:57.850	optimistic in the sense that I believe that essentially the
207	00:14:57.860	00:15:01.050	things we are doing are right. We believe in the
208	00:15:01.060	00:15:06.150	sanctity of life and the freedom of human beings. We
209	00:15:06.160	00:15:09.670	believe that a majority of nations share that point of
210	00:15:09.680	00:15:12.570	view, and we have a lot going for us in
211	00:15:12.580	00:15:15.540	terms of our idealism, in terms of our track record.
212	00:15:15.550	00:15:18.060	I think we have to be optimistic about that. I
213	00:15:18.070	00:15:21.390	think, secondly, we are a great power. We're working with
214	00:15:21.400	00:15:25.290	other great powers. We have, it seems to me, many
215	00:15:25.300	00:15:28.650	more options and much more political stability than do the
216	00:15:28.660	00:15:30.900	people with whom we're contending. In other words, there are
217	00:15:30.910	00:15:34.920	things going on that make you feel hopeful that this
218	00:15:34.930	00:15:37.270	thing is going to be resolved fairly quickly? Yes, there
219	00:15:37.280	00:15:41.220	are. And, as a matter of fact, the President today
220	00:15:41.230	00:15:45.820	in his meeting with bipartisan leadership of course gave an
221	00:15:45.830	00:15:49.790	opportunity for Mr. McFarlane to brief us all, to give
222	00:15:49.800	00:15:52.070	us the parameters of what we might be doing. But
223	00:15:52.080	00:15:55.710	we also discussed the need to move to cut the
224	00:15:55.720	00:15:59.930	budget deficit, to have a tax bill and reform, to
225	00:15:59.940	00:16:03.580	get the appropriations on track. This is the government that
226	00:16:03.590	00:16:07.920	is operating. I would think perhaps the hostage crisis has
227	00:16:07.930	00:16:11.800	brought us together with much more intensity, with maybe more
228	00:16:11.810	00:16:15.780	urgency with regard to the requirements for successful governance of
229	00:16:15.790	00:16:20.750	this country. The options on the Lebanon crisis, if diplomacy
230	00:16:20.760	00:16:23.240	does not work. Did the President indicate to you how
231	00:16:23.250	00:16:27.560	long he's going to let these diplomatic avenues run their
232	00:16:27.570	00:16:30.590	course before he takes any further action? No, the President
233	00:16:30.600	00:16:33.230	has not made a decision on that, and I don't
234	00:16:33.240	00:16:36.450	think that he ought to. I think his role is
235	00:16:36.460	00:16:41.180	to explore each of the avenues and to continue applying
236	00:16:41.190	00:16:46.140	pressure, to continue trying out new situations. There is no particular
237	00:16:46.150	00:16:49.000	reason we ought to signal what day and what hour
238	00:16:49.010	00:16:51.260	we believe something ought to come into play. I think
239	00:16:51.270	00:16:55.050	we are required, however, to set the stage for our
240	00:16:55.060	00:16:58.330	allies or for even nations that are not too friendly
241	00:16:58.340	00:17:02.080	for the American people to understand various options, so that
242	00:17:02.090	00:17:04.800	when and if the time comes that the President asks
243	00:17:04.810	00:17:07.330	for cooperation he receives it. You know, for example, the
244	00:17:07.340	00:17:10.620	other evening he suggested that it would not be advisable
245	00:17:10.630	00:17:14.120	to fly into Greece in the same numbers that we
246	00:17:14.130	00:17:17.990	had been doing. Some Americans observed that that was probably
247	00:17:18.000	00:17:20.840	right. Others said, "We've got vacations and plans and we're
248	00:17:20.850	00:17:23.910	going about life as usual." We're going to have to
249	00:17:23.920	00:17:26.680	come into a different mode, I think, of public cooperation
250	00:17:26.690	00:17:28.840	in this country, and I think the President is wisely
251	00:17:28.850	00:17:31.710	setting the stage for that. What's your own view of
252	00:17:31.720	00:17:35.340	an economic boycott of Lebanon as a way to go?
253	00:17:35.350	00:17:40.410	I think it entirely depends upon the specifics, and I
254	00:17:40.420	00:17:45.250	think these will be carefully drafted as potential options that
255	00:17:45.260	00:17:48.280	Lebanon--How would it be done, Senator? Well, I suspect
256	00:17:48.290	00:17:52.660	that through the cooperation of the nations that are involved
257	00:17:52.670	00:17:56.190	in the trade of Lebanon. Some would cooperate, hopefully; some
258	00:17:56.200	00:18:00.720	might not. But Lebanon is a country with great difficulties.
259	00:18:00.730	00:18:03.300	I think we have to assume that some of the
260	00:18:03.310	00:18:08.290	Lebanese factions are not that keen on the Shiite Moslems
261	00:18:08.300	00:18:11.170	to begin with, that there could in fact be some
262	00:18:11.180	00:18:14.290	pressure internally within Lebanon to deal with the rest of
263	00:18:14.300	00:18:17.160	the world. Same on closing the Beirut airport to all
264	00:18:17.170	00:18:21.040	airline traffic? Well, that would be a more substantial step.
265	00:18:21.050	00:18:25.310	Secretary Shultz has pointed out that 15% of all hijackings
266	00:18:25.320	00:18:28.330	in recent times have occurred in or out of the
267	00:18:28.340	00:18:34.470	Beirut airport. We had a continual amount of terrorism sort
268	00:18:34.480	00:18:37.610	of originating in that situation. That may not be the
269	00:18:37.620	00:18:40.200	only airport in the world that needs attention, but that
270	00:18:40.210	00:18:42.400	certainly is one and that would make a difference. How
271	00:18:42.410	00:18:45.040	would we close it down, sir? How could the United
272	00:18:45.050	00:18:46.970	States close it down? Well, there are means of doing
273	00:18:46.980	00:18:48.810	that, and I really don't want to get into the
274	00:18:48.820	00:18:52.280	tactics, but I think the overall situation is one that
275	00:18:52.290	00:18:54.600	is fully within our power. There was a report on
276	00:18:54.610	00:18:57.410	CNN late today that one of the options was to
277	00:18:57.420	00:19:00.980	bomb the airport closed. Is that being seriously considered? Well,
278	00:19:00.990	00:19:03.900	I think that that would be a very serious step.
279	00:19:03.910	00:19:08.000	I think the options the President discussed, at least publicly
280	00:19:08.010	00:19:13.360	today, are ones that do not require that violence or
281	00:19:13.370	00:19:16.190	potential loss of life. The President is operating in a
282	00:19:16.200	00:19:20.280	very humane and, it seems to me, careful, prudent manner.
283	00:19:20.290	00:19:24.450	Senator, thank you. Robin? We discuss the President's actions and
284	00:19:24.460	00:19:27.640	further options now with three Americans with different experience and
285	00:19:27.650	00:19:33.030	perspectives. Joining us at public station WTTW-Chicago are Donald Rumsfeld,
286	00:19:33.040	00:19:36.250	President Ford's secretary of defense and for a while a
287	00:19:36.260	00:19:40.120	special Middle East representative for President Reagan; and Joseph Sisco,
288	00:19:40.130	00:19:43.990	undersecretary of state in the Nixon and Ford administrations. Here
289	00:19:44.000	00:19:47.280	in New York is Jesse Jackson, whose contacts with Syria
290	00:19:47.290	00:19:49.980	secured the release of a captured Navy pilot during the
291	00:19:49.990	00:19:54.160	U.S. involvement in Lebanon. Starting with you, Joseph Sisco, how
292	00:19:54.170	00:19:57.190	do you react to the course that Senator Lugar has
293	00:19:57.200	00:20:00.350	outlined, the course of action Senator Lugar has outlined? Well,
294	00:20:00.360	00:20:03.310	the President underscored in his press conference that he's going
295	00:20:03.320	00:20:08.680	to explore every diplomatic avenue. I think we've got to
296	00:20:08.690	00:20:13.510	continue on this course of action. If there are some
297	00:20:13.520	00:20:16.130	modest points of pressure that can be applied, it might
298	00:20:16.140	00:20:18.910	be helpful, but it seems to me that we're committed
299	00:20:18.920	00:20:23.730	to a course of working through Nabih Berri. The Syrians
300	00:20:23.740	00:20:28.790	have very considerable influence in Lebanon, and you could make
301	00:20:28.800	00:20:30.620	a case that from the point of view of their
302	00:20:30.630	00:20:34.970	national interests they could be helpful. Whether they will or
303	00:20:34.980	00:20:38.550	not, I think this has to be tested, as well
304	00:20:38.560	00:20:41.170	as a number of other countries that have influence in
305	00:20:41.180	00:20:44.670	this situation. I think for the time being the President
306	00:20:44.680	00:20:48.410	is right in pursuing all of these diplomatic avenues. What
307	00:20:48.420	00:20:51.860	do you think, Donald Rumsfeld? My personal view is that
308	00:20:51.870	00:20:55.600	the President is correct in making a judgment that it
309	00:20:55.610	00:20:57.900	would be harmful to the United States and the people
310	00:20:57.910	00:21:00.650	of the United States to yield to the terrorists. I
311	00:21:00.660	00:21:03.020	think what's important is that we come out of this
312	00:21:03.030	00:21:08.640	incident, this circumstance, this terribly tragic situation, with a broadly
313	00:21:08.650	00:21:12.040	accepted anti-terrorist policy for the United States of America. The
314	00:21:12.050	00:21:13.940	fact of the matter is that the purpose of terrorism
315	00:21:13.950	00:21:16.730	is to terrorize. It's also true that there are states
316	00:21:16.740	00:21:20.530	that sponsor it, that facilitate it and that tolerate it.
317	00:21:20.540	00:21:22.730	And it strikes me that it's time for the international
318	00:21:22.740	00:21:26.980	community to make lepers of those nations and impose political-economic
319	00:21:26.990	00:21:29.320	sanctions on them. I also think it's time for the
320	00:21:29.330	00:21:33.330	United States to provide the American people the reasonable level
321	00:21:33.340	00:21:38.130	of intelligence-gathering capability that they ought to expect, and to
322	00:21:38.140	00:21:44.040	train and equip and exercise and deploy military capabilities so
323	00:21:44.050	00:21:48.950	that on selective occasions they'll be available for preemption in
324	00:21:48.960	00:21:53.370	the event intelligence information permits that, rescue where it's appropriate
325	00:21:53.380	00:21:56.820	and, in other instances, retaliation where that may be appropriate.
326	00:21:56.830	00:21:59.160	Jesse Jackson, how do you react to the course that
327	00:21:59.170	00:22:01.420	you just heard Senator Lugar outline the President's going to
328	00:22:01.430	00:22:05.210	take? Well, if the object is to save American lives,
329	00:22:05.220	00:22:08.080	we ought to pursue the course of negotiations over and
330	00:22:08.090	00:22:11.340	against any kind of military option. A military option would
331	00:22:11.350	00:22:15.390	most certainly--a) we'd be killing innocent people there and
332	00:22:15.400	00:22:18.410	most assuredly get the Americans killed. And so if the
333	00:22:18.420	00:22:22.730	object is saving their lives, then the process of negotiation
334	00:22:22.740	00:22:25.970	ought to continue. We ought to quit playing a game
335	00:22:25.980	00:22:28.920	suggesting that we are not negotiating. We are not negotiating
336	00:22:28.930	00:22:33.220	directly, perhaps, but we are negotiating through third parties, hoping
337	00:22:33.230	00:22:36.890	that Israel on the one hand can help us by
338	00:22:36.900	00:22:40.050	closing the window on the earlier release than they had
339	00:22:40.060	00:22:43.600	planned of the hostages because there is linkage between the
340	00:22:43.610	00:22:46.280	hostages and those who are being detained in Israel. On
341	00:22:46.290	00:22:49.470	the other hand, making an even broader appeal to Syria
342	00:22:49.480	00:22:52.790	to become even more involved because the reality is Syria
343	00:22:52.800	00:22:55.430	is a key factor in this situation. Among other things,
344	00:22:55.440	00:22:59.940	they occupy at least 70% of Lebanon and perhaps influence
345	00:22:59.950	00:23:01.750	it all. So I would hope if we're going to
346	00:23:01.760	00:23:05.800	pursue the route of negotiations that our language and rhetoric
347	00:23:05.810	00:23:08.500	style is that of that kind of an appeal and
348	00:23:08.510	00:23:12.220	reaching out. And if there is any military contingency plan,
349	00:23:12.230	00:23:15.020	it ought not be overt and threatening. In other words,
350	00:23:15.030	00:23:19.200	the hijackers did not threaten and have a press conference.
351	00:23:19.210	00:23:22.360	They acted and then had a press conference. So if
352	00:23:22.370	00:23:25.670	we're going to pursue negotiations, let's pursue that route, but
353	00:23:25.680	00:23:28.970	let's not jeopardize those who are there now by giving
354	00:23:28.980	00:23:30.410	the appearance of a threat. What do you think we
355	00:23:30.420	00:23:32.180	should be doing with Israel, first, before we move on
356	00:23:32.190	00:23:34.940	to Syria? Well, first of all, it's certain the President
357	00:23:34.950	00:23:38.180	did say that the holding of the detainees there is
358	00:23:38.190	00:23:41.080	against international law, and that was a rather major statement
359	00:23:41.090	00:23:43.030	for the President to make. On the other hand, the
360	00:23:43.040	00:23:46.400	holding of the American hostages is against international law, and
361	00:23:46.410	00:23:50.820	that's why some pursuit of a mutual exchange is significant.
362	00:23:50.830	00:23:53.520	You must appreciate the fact that as long as those
363	00:23:53.530	00:23:58.190	detainees remain in Israel, the less secure it makes Israel
364	00:23:58.200	00:24:01.930	as opposed to more secure. It's costing money, it's costing
365	00:24:01.940	00:24:05.110	politics, it's creating a greater target. So we ought to
366	00:24:05.120	00:24:09.990	be in a mode of encouraging an early mutual release.
367	00:24:10.000	00:24:11.460	What do you think of that, Joe Sisco, that we
368	00:24:11.470	00:24:15.020	should be increasing the pressure on Israel to get those
369	00:24:15.030	00:24:19.920	detainees out? My own feeling is that if an understanding
370	00:24:19.930	00:24:22.990	can be achieved, that the question of the release of
371	00:24:23.000	00:24:28.500	the detainees is not going to be the prime obstacle
372	00:24:28.510	00:24:34.790	in the situation. Equally important is whether Nabih Berri has
373	00:24:34.800	00:24:40.610	the power to achieve an understanding and to actually put
374	00:24:40.620	00:24:44.050	together a deal that he could make stick. I think
375	00:24:44.060	00:24:47.110	there is a big question mark in this regard, and
376	00:24:47.120	00:24:51.750	therefore I believe that the dialogue has to continue to
377	00:24:51.760	00:24:56.540	see whether these two elements can interact in a way
378	00:24:56.550	00:25:00.550	in which there will be no concessions and the number-one
379	00:25:00.560	00:25:04.630	priority is implemented, namely, the freeing of the hostages. Mr.
380	00:25:04.640	00:25:08.220	Rumsfeld, is the position we're not going to negotiate with
381	00:25:08.230	00:25:11.430	the terrorists, is that a realistic position? I think that
382	00:25:11.440	00:25:13.640	the--I mean, isn't there in fact going to be,
383	00:25:13.650	00:25:17.050	and hasn't there been all along, veiled negotiation to get
384	00:25:17.060	00:25:19.730	this exchange done and get it over with? Well, obviously
385	00:25:19.740	00:25:22.220	there have been a lot of public pronouncements by Nabih
386	00:25:22.230	00:25:25.110	Berri and by President Reagan and by a whole number
387	00:25:25.120	00:25:28.930	of participants to this exercise. But I think what's important
388	00:25:28.940	00:25:31.480	to appreciate, from the standpoint of the United States, is
389	00:25:31.490	00:25:33.770	that it's the obligation of the President of the United
390	00:25:33.780	00:25:37.150	States to interest himself in the safety of these hostages
391	00:25:37.160	00:25:40.170	to be sure, but it's also to interest himself in
392	00:25:40.180	00:25:43.570	the safety of the American people all across this globe.
393	00:25:43.580	00:25:47.820	And he has to, for example, recognize that how he
394	00:25:47.830	00:25:51.230	manages this situation will have an effect on the lives
395	00:25:51.240	00:25:54.080	of other Americans, and we can't withdraw from the world.
396	00:25:54.090	00:25:56.160	We have interests in the world. Second, it will have
397	00:25:56.170	00:25:59.710	an effect on Western Europe. What will Western Europe think
398	00:25:59.720	00:26:04.210	if the United States alters its policy dramatically because we
399	00:26:04.220	00:26:07.350	have hostages held? That would suggest to them that our
400	00:26:07.360	00:26:10.190	commitments to Europe are not worth much. What would King
401	00:26:10.200	00:26:13.850	Hussein in Jordan, who we have an obligation and interest
402	00:26:13.860	00:26:16.300	in seeing proceed with the peace process in the Middle
403	00:26:16.310	00:26:20.410	East--what's his view when he sees U.S. policy spin
404	00:26:20.420	00:26:24.690	a 180-degree turn--were it to do so--because some
405	00:26:24.700	00:26:28.420	hostages were taken? So a President has an obligation that
406	00:26:28.430	00:26:32.020	is broader and bigger, it seems to me, than the
407	00:26:32.030	00:26:37.470	kind of public micromanagement and amateur brain-surgeoning that's taking place
408	00:26:37.480	00:26:40.660	on the public airwaves with respect to this crisis. It
409	00:26:40.670	00:26:43.800	seems to me that we ought to call a negotiation
410	00:26:43.810	00:26:47.030	a negotiation and we ought to call a linkage, linkage
411	00:26:47.040	00:26:49.700	because that's what we are looking at. We ought to
412	00:26:49.710	00:26:52.920	seek the release of the hostages, the 47 of them,
413	00:26:52.930	00:26:57.410	not just the 40 of them, but release and reevaluation
414	00:26:57.420	00:27:00.220	of our foreign policy is in order, for when you
415	00:27:00.230	00:27:04.340	negotiate you are in fact using moral authority and credibility
416	00:27:04.350	00:27:06.930	and leverage. Mr. Rumsfeld says that it would weaken the
417	00:27:06.940	00:27:09.510	overall posture of the United States if the President were
418	00:27:09.520	00:27:13.770	to do something to achieve what you've just described which
419	00:27:13.780	00:27:17.710	made other nations doubt. One of the reevaluation factors is
420	00:27:17.720	00:27:22.440	that in that region we have substantial interests but our--
421	00:27:22.450	00:27:25.540	we have too few interests and too few friends, and
422	00:27:25.550	00:27:28.950	so a good foreign policy there must broaden the base
423	00:27:28.960	00:27:31.510	of friends and allies. It is not good politics, in
424	00:27:31.520	00:27:34.220	my judgment, or good reasoning in that region to have
425	00:27:34.230	00:27:37.990	a secondary relationship between our President and Mr. Assad as
426	00:27:38.000	00:27:41.150	opposed to a primary one. We ought to be against
427	00:27:41.160	00:27:44.820	terrorism, but then you can't really say it with gusto
428	00:27:44.830	00:27:47.690	when you're South Africa's number-one trading partner. And that's why
429	00:27:47.700	00:27:52.100	reevaluation is as important as our negotiating for release. What
430	00:27:52.110	00:27:53.770	do you think of that, Mr. Sisco, that we need
431	00:27:53.780	00:27:56.700	to reevaluate the whole foreign policy in the area? Well,
432	00:27:56.710	00:28:00.210	my own judgment is that as far as President Assad
433	00:28:00.220	00:28:02.380	is concerned, with whom I have had over the years
434	00:28:02.390	00:28:06.630	as many as 15 or 20 meetings, this is a
435	00:28:06.640	00:28:12.950	tough, shrewd Syrian nationalist and objectively speaking, there are reasons
436	00:28:12.960	00:28:18.370	why he should want a semblance of stability in Lebanon,
437	00:28:18.380	00:28:21.740	largely because he's got internal problems of his own to
438	00:28:21.750	00:28:24.770	attend to. I believe the course of our policy in
439	00:28:24.780	00:28:28.210	the Middle East has been sound. We've been the indispensable
440	00:28:28.220	00:28:32.560	third-party element to try to make progress on the Arab-Israeli-Palestinian
441	00:28:32.570	00:28:35.250	issue. The only progress that's been made over the last
442	00:28:35.260	00:28:38.270	12 years has been under the aegis of the United
443	00:28:38.280	00:28:41.910	States, and therefore the fact that we're an object of
444	00:28:41.920	00:28:45.020	terrorism I think attests to the fact that we're the
445	00:28:45.030	00:28:48.160	crucial element in the situation. I would add this, if
446	00:28:48.170	00:28:51.940	I might, that with the exception of Syria and Iran
447	00:28:51.950	00:28:55.200	and Libya, I think it's reasonable to say that most
448	00:28:55.210	00:28:58.670	of the nations of the Middle East, the overwhelming majority, are
449	00:28:58.680	00:29:02.490	deeply concerned about terrorism. They are in fear for their
450	00:29:02.500	00:29:06.120	regimes, for their diplomats. A number of Jordanian diplomats have
451	00:29:06.130	00:29:09.530	been killed. It is not to suggest that by suddenly
452	00:29:09.540	00:29:12.640	altering our policy with respect to terrorism that we would
453	00:29:12.650	00:29:15.690	gain the friendship of these nations. They're as concerned as
454	00:29:15.700	00:29:18.570	we are about terrorism. I'd just like to go around
455	00:29:18.580	00:29:20.730	to each of you very quickly: do you think that
456	00:29:20.740	00:29:24.690	if the measures we heard outlined, the economic boycott, the
457	00:29:24.700	00:29:27.960	closing of the airport, were achieved, that they would increase
458	00:29:27.970	00:29:31.320	the pressure on the people holding the hostages? Mr. Sisco,
459	00:29:31.330	00:29:34.900	do you think so? A psychological signal that we're there
460	00:29:34.910	00:29:37.830	and that we have power, but I do not assume
461	00:29:37.840	00:29:42.040	that it will have or would have any decisive impact
462	00:29:42.050	00:29:45.640	on the actual dialogue that's going on. Mr. Rumsfeld? My
463	00:29:45.650	00:29:47.720	view is that the President of the United States has
464	00:29:47.730	00:29:53.040	a very difficult assignment in this instance, that the task
465	00:29:53.050	00:29:55.630	ought to be not to simplify the problem for the
466	00:29:55.640	00:29:59.150	terrorists and those who wish us ill but to complexify
467	00:29:59.160	00:30:01.850	it. And I don't think that by discussing specific things
468	00:30:01.860	00:30:05.010	he might do that it contributes constructively to his handling
469	00:30:05.020	00:30:07.150	of it. What do you think of the measures--If
470	00:30:07.160	00:30:11.570	we're not the essential supplier to Lebanon, then cutting off
471	00:30:11.580	00:30:16.690	supplies will not radically affect that situation. Secondly, if that
472	00:30:16.700	00:30:20.120	were a coherent government as we know governments to be,
473	00:30:20.130	00:30:22.570	that would work better than it would work in this
474	00:30:22.580	00:30:26.890	situation. I think that appealing more and more to Israel,
475	00:30:26.900	00:30:30.180	appealing more and more to Syria to be an active
476	00:30:30.190	00:30:33.520	third force in this situation may be our best route
477	00:30:33.530	00:30:35.650	out. And I hope that we will pursue the route
478	00:30:35.660	00:30:38.660	of negotiation and if there are other options the government
479	00:30:38.670	00:30:41.400	certainly ought to reserve the right to not surface them.
480	00:30:41.410	00:30:44.250	Thank you. Jim? Yes, back to you, Senator Lugar. You've
481	00:30:44.260	00:30:46.800	been listening to this. Is Reverend Jackson right that the
482	00:30:46.810	00:30:50.830	answer to this really lies with Israel and Syria? Not
483	00:30:50.840	00:30:57.230	necessarily, but clearly our request to Assad to help in
484	00:30:57.240	00:30:59.470	Syria is an important one. He could make a big
485	00:30:59.480	00:31:03.100	difference. He could influence Nabih Berri and, indeed, they may
486	00:31:03.110	00:31:05.470	have been in consultation today on this point. So that's
487	00:31:05.480	00:31:09.410	an important link. Israel is crucial for a good number
488	00:31:09.420	00:31:11.910	of reasons, some of which are obvious, some of which
489	00:31:11.920	00:31:16.360	may be seen in the future. But I think, as
490	00:31:16.370	00:31:19.170	Mr. Rumsfeld said, we need to have a complex series
491	00:31:19.180	00:31:21.830	of things as opposed to trying to define what will
492	00:31:21.840	00:31:24.550	work, what won't work, quantify it in advance. Let's sort
493	00:31:24.560	00:31:28.480	of keep the ball rolling. Well, is Syria being helpful thus
494	00:31:28.490	00:31:33.560	far? Well, I don't want to characterize that dialogue. It's
495	00:31:33.570	00:31:37.230	an important one. It's an ongoing one presently. And I
496	00:31:37.240	00:31:41.120	would just appeal for everybody to keep that channel open
497	00:31:41.130	00:31:44.750	and to suspend judgment until we really know what they're
498	00:31:44.760	00:31:47.700	willing to do. For whatever reasons, is there any indication
499	00:31:47.710	00:31:52.330	tonight that Israel may soon release the 700 detainees? No
500	00:31:52.340	00:31:56.250	more so than last night. Israel will move in accordance
501	00:31:56.260	00:31:59.690	with Israeli law. That's what Israel ought to do. I
502	00:31:59.700	00:32:04.410	reject entirely the idea of linkage, of negotiation with terrorists.
503	00:32:04.420	00:32:06.360	That will not going to occur on our part or
504	00:32:06.370	00:32:08.920	that of Israel. Well, what about Reverend Jackson's point, whether
505	00:32:08.930	00:32:11.510	you call it negotiation or not, it's still negotiations if
506	00:32:11.520	00:32:15.040	you're talking to people. Not necessarily so. There's a pretty
507	00:32:15.050	00:32:21.340	good distinction between negotiations and consultation, conversation, whispering in the
508	00:32:21.350	00:32:23.470	ear or this type of thing. I think when we're
509	00:32:23.480	00:32:27.480	talking about negotiations we are defining parties, their status, their
510	00:32:27.490	00:32:31.640	legitimacy, and it has a very important distinction. All right,
511	00:32:31.650	00:32:35.280	Senator Lugar, thank you very much. Robin? Still to come
512	00:32:35.290	00:32:37.750	on the NewsHour tonight, the failure of House and Senate
513	00:32:37.760	00:32:40.500	conferees to agree on a new budget with two of
514	00:32:40.510	00:32:44.200	the key players, Senator William Armstrong and Congressman William Gray;
515	00:32:44.210	00:32:47.340	and a newsmaker interview with Senate Finance Committee chairman Robert
516	00:32:47.350	00:33:02.800	Packwood. Now to focus segment two, the breakdown on the
517	00:33:02.810	00:33:06.070	budget. Two weeks ago 26 members of a House and
518	00:33:06.080	00:33:09.490	Senate conference committee opened negotiations over how to trim the
519	00:33:09.500	00:33:14.750	1986 federal budget. Both agreed $56-or-so billion was the right
520	00:33:14.760	00:33:17.950	amount, but disagreed over how to do it. The big
521	00:33:17.960	00:33:21.750	differences were over defense spending and Social Security. Well, today
522	00:33:21.760	00:33:24.890	they hollered uncle. Compromise turned out to be impossible, said
523	00:33:24.900	00:33:28.800	they; the conference committee's work is done and has failed.
524	00:33:28.810	00:33:31.760	First, correspondent June Cross reports on the two weeks of
525	00:33:31.770	00:33:39.110	wrangling that led to today's breakdown. The Senate wants to
526	00:33:39.120	00:33:42.870	freeze cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security. The House wants a
527	00:33:42.880	00:33:46.880	freeze on defense. There things stood last Wednesday when Senate
528	00:33:46.890	00:33:50.850	conference chairman Pete Domenici offered a compromise. The Senate would
529	00:33:50.860	00:33:54.360	add more for low-income programs, but only if the House
530	00:33:54.370	00:33:58.710	would add inflation increases for defense. House conference chairman Bill
531	00:33:58.720	00:34:01.670	Gray nixed that idea. Then on Friday he made a
532	00:34:01.680	00:34:06.080	counter-offer. The House would eliminate $1.5 billion more in social
533	00:34:06.090	00:34:08.960	spending, but there would be no give on either defense
534	00:34:08.970	00:34:13.090	or Social Security. That led Senate Republican Slade Gorton to
535	00:34:13.100	00:34:16.400	call the Democrats' bluff. I don't see any really serious
536	00:34:16.410	00:34:20.320	changes in this from the original House position at all.
537	00:34:20.330	00:34:22.720	They have made no changes at all in the two
538	00:34:22.730	00:34:31.280	largest functions of defense and in the various income security
539	00:34:31.290	00:34:36.410	and Social Security areas, and they've made exceedingly cosmetic changes
540	00:34:36.420	00:34:39.050	in a number of other areas. By their own figures
541	00:34:39.060	00:34:44.770	they amount to only $1.5 billion. A billion and a
542	00:34:44.780	00:34:47.430	half is not chicken feed. In some of the areas
543	00:34:47.440	00:34:51.070	we made very--more cuts were very painful, such as
544	00:34:51.080	00:34:54.260	in the Appalachia Regional Commission, the EDA, all these other
545	00:34:54.270	00:35:00.680	areas. We didn't--if that's going to be the position,
546	00:35:00.690	00:35:05.850	we should decide and not waste members' time sitting talking
547	00:35:05.860	00:35:08.890	about different functions. If we're going to accomplish nothing, it's
548	00:35:08.900	00:35:10.760	no point in sitting here. So let's take out and go
549	00:35:10.770	00:35:14.400	to the House. We went about 90% your way on
550	00:35:14.410	00:35:18.810	what you called poverty programs. We didn't even argue whether
551	00:35:18.820	00:35:23.510	they were or they weren't. About 90% when you take
552	00:35:23.520	00:35:28.980	housing out. That isn't enough. I mean, your counter-offer, no,
553	00:35:28.990	00:35:31.160	it might say thanks, but in the meantime it says
554	00:35:31.170	00:35:34.560	you want all of it. Democratic Senator Lawton Chiles attempted
555	00:35:34.570	00:35:37.180	to bridge the gap between Senate Republicans and the House
556	00:35:37.190	00:35:40.100	Democrats. I'm sure that with the cards that we're now
557	00:35:40.110	00:35:44.280	playing with there's no way you can play this hand
558	00:35:44.290	00:35:49.370	and come out with a deficit reduction that is sufficient
559	00:35:49.380	00:35:53.620	to really help this economy the way we should. You
560	00:35:53.630	00:35:57.170	know, we've got two issues here, defense and Social Security.
561	00:35:57.180	00:35:59.730	No, I'm not making an offer at this point because
562	00:35:59.740	00:36:02.130	I'm not authorized to do so for my conferees, but
563	00:36:02.140	00:36:04.820	you know maybe what we could do is we give
564	00:36:04.830	00:36:06.850	you defense and you give us the COLA. Then we
565	00:36:06.860	00:36:08.570	can begin to fight on the rest of it right
566	00:36:08.580	00:36:14.960	here. How do you think about that? What?! It's split.
567	00:36:14.970	00:36:18.200	All your way. I mean, on the major account. You'd
568	00:36:18.210	00:36:21.560	get defense. You said, you give us our defense and
569	00:36:21.570	00:36:23.910	we give you your COLAs? I didn't hear it that
570	00:36:23.920	00:36:29.580	way; I heard it the reverse. You said we go
571	00:36:29.590	00:36:32.740	with our defense number and your COLA number? Is that
572	00:36:32.750	00:36:35.970	your offer, not that I'm going to accept it. No,
573	00:36:35.980	00:36:41.260	that's not an offer. Although Gray's joke had lessened the
574	00:36:41.270	00:36:45.160	tension, no one had budged. Democrats and Republicans on both
575	00:36:45.170	00:36:48.600	sides talked among themselves over the weekend. They talked some
576	00:36:48.610	00:36:52.340	more behind closed doors yesterday. But for all the talking,
577	00:36:52.350	00:36:54.900	the two sides were no closer today than they were
578	00:36:54.910	00:36:58.670	last week. I don't want this to be interpreted in
579	00:36:58.680	00:37:04.120	any way that the House conferees and in particular the
580	00:37:04.130	00:37:07.840	distinguished chairman of the House conference have not tried their
581	00:37:07.850	00:37:12.030	very best. It's just one of those situations for now
582	00:37:12.040	00:37:16.100	that, consistent with the confines of these two budget resolutions,
583	00:37:16.110	00:37:18.870	there seems to the Senator from New Mexico, chairman of
584	00:37:18.880	00:37:22.550	this conference and the chairman of the Senate conferees, that
585	00:37:22.560	00:37:26.650	no useful purpose will be served, with the situation being
586	00:37:26.660	00:37:29.830	what it is, for us to proceed. The deadlock makes
587	00:37:29.840	00:37:33.760	compromise seem impossible. House and Senate leaders say that makes
588	00:37:33.770	00:37:36.650	it likely that both houses will pass their own spending
589	00:37:36.660	00:37:41.660	bills without agreeing on any budget resolution at all. On
590	00:37:41.670	00:37:44.990	the House side of the negotiations, House Budget Committee chairman
591	00:37:45.000	00:37:47.510	William Gray is with us; from the Senate, Senator William
592	00:37:47.520	00:37:50.150	Armstrong, a member of the Senate Budget Committee. They are
593	00:37:50.160	00:37:53.180	both in a studio on Capitol Hill. Senator Armstrong, what
594	00:37:53.190	00:37:57.050	went wrong from your perspective? Well, I don't think we're
595	00:37:57.060	00:38:00.760	off the rails yet. We're at a point of decision-making,
596	00:38:00.770	00:38:04.790	and I believe that the breakdown or the suspension of
597	00:38:04.800	00:38:08.390	the budget conference now is really quite timely, because I
598	00:38:08.400	00:38:10.850	think what'll happen is that as the members go home
599	00:38:10.860	00:38:13.540	over the 4th of July recess they're going to hear
600	00:38:13.550	00:38:15.970	from their constituents, "You guys get back to the table
601	00:38:15.980	00:38:18.390	and put something together." Do you really think the public
602	00:38:18.400	00:38:20.450	cares that much about this? Yes, indeed I do. In
603	00:38:20.460	00:38:22.620	fact, the republic's got a lot of things on its
604	00:38:22.630	00:38:24.960	mind, but with the possible exception of the hostage issue,
605	00:38:24.970	00:38:28.990	I believe that the most pressing public policy concern that
606	00:38:29.000	00:38:30.890	people feel at home, that they really feel in their
607	00:38:30.900	00:38:34.300	heart, is this budget deficit question. Well, Senator, if you
608	00:38:34.310	00:38:36.420	were to go home to Colorado, is there anything a
609	00:38:36.430	00:38:38.910	constituent could tell you that would change your view on
610	00:38:38.920	00:38:42.550	any of these issues that caused this breakdown? Well, you
611	00:38:42.560	00:38:45.790	know, I don't think I'm the crux of the matter
612	00:38:45.800	00:38:49.020	because I'm there to make a deal. In fact, I
613	00:38:49.030	00:38:51.210	think we're a lot closer perhaps than some people might
614	00:38:51.220	00:38:53.460	believe. And the essence of a good deal at this
615	00:38:53.470	00:38:55.140	point would be to take the low numbers. Where the
616	00:38:55.150	00:38:57.310	House is low, take the House numbers. Where the Senate
617	00:38:57.320	00:38:59.590	is low, take the Senate numbers. Now, that would mean,
618	00:38:59.600	00:39:02.010	in my opinion, that we'd end up pretty close to
619	00:39:02.020	00:39:06.080	the Senate numbers on domestic programs and cost-of-living adjustments and
620	00:39:06.090	00:39:08.960	pretty close to the House numbers on national defense. There'd
621	00:39:08.970	00:39:11.160	be a lot of people who'd holler about that, but
622	00:39:11.170	00:39:13.120	in one form or another--In other words--it'd be
623	00:39:13.130	00:39:15.240	popular in a lot of places. In simple terms, you
624	00:39:15.250	00:39:21.190	would still cut defense spending about what? Explain that in
625	00:39:21.200	00:39:24.730	the two key areas, Social Security and defense. Well, the
626	00:39:24.740	00:39:26.930	essence of it is that the Senate has proposed to
627	00:39:26.940	00:39:31.910	cut Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, the cost-of-living adjustments for federal
628	00:39:31.920	00:39:34.520	employees, retirees and others and a number of other domestic
629	00:39:34.530	00:39:38.080	programs. I'm saying in my own opinion a good compromise
630	00:39:38.090	00:39:40.610	would be to take the Senate numbers on those programs
631	00:39:40.620	00:39:43.940	and then in defense, where we're above the House, to
632	00:39:43.950	00:39:46.040	go to the House number. In other words, it'd be
633	00:39:46.050	00:39:49.190	a symmetrical compromise, but it'd be a compromise for lower
634	00:39:49.200	00:39:53.290	spending rather than for bidding spending up. Congressman Gray, is
635	00:39:53.300	00:39:56.600	that the makings of a deal? No, I don't think
636	00:39:56.610	00:39:58.920	it is the makings of a deal. I think clearly
637	00:39:58.930	00:40:00.670	when you look at the vote that we had in
638	00:40:00.680	00:40:03.520	the House for a budget resolution, they got the greatest
639	00:40:03.530	00:40:07.130	number of votes since the budget act bipartisanly. We were
640	00:40:07.140	00:40:10.000	saying that there are some policy choices that we have
641	00:40:10.010	00:40:13.490	to make and not just numbers. The policy choices were
642	00:40:13.500	00:40:19.240	to restrain defense spending, give defense a $15.1-billion increase, freeze
643	00:40:19.250	00:40:24.530	budget authority; secondly, reduce domestic spending a great deal but
644	00:40:24.540	00:40:29.960	without eliminating a dozen programs and providing for an inflationary
645	00:40:29.970	00:40:36.620	increase for low-income programs and then a policy decision bipartisanly
646	00:40:36.630	00:40:40.270	made that we did not want to freeze the cost-of-living
647	00:40:40.280	00:40:44.780	adjustment for our veterans and for our elderly. We are
648	00:40:44.790	00:40:48.870	not freezing defense, we are freezing the budget authority. You
649	00:40:48.880	00:40:53.600	are giving $15.1 billion additional in outlays. And it was
650	00:40:53.610	00:40:56.800	the feeling of the House bipartisanly that that would be
651	00:40:56.810	00:41:00.720	inappropriate. What we suggested to our colleagues in the Senate
652	00:41:00.730	00:41:06.070	was that the framework for a decision might be one
653	00:41:06.080	00:41:09.210	for the defense question and the COLA question to be
654	00:41:09.220	00:41:13.410	linked together structurally and that we would move to their
655	00:41:13.420	00:41:17.820	position on the budget authority on defense, which is what
656	00:41:17.830	00:41:22.080	the President wanted and which also Caspar Weinberger said was
657	00:41:22.090	00:41:25.500	needed, and they would also come to our position on
658	00:41:25.510	00:41:29.730	COLAs. And thus, as a result of last week's deliberations,
659	00:41:29.740	00:41:33.010	where we clearly demonstrated a willingness to cut more as
660	00:41:33.020	00:41:36.220	well as eliminate half a dozen programs which we had
661	00:41:36.230	00:41:40.000	not eliminated in the House budget proposal and their willingness
662	00:41:40.010	00:41:42.810	to go up in the low-income programs, we felt that
663	00:41:42.820	00:41:45.150	we could come to some discussion--decision. And then what
664	00:41:45.160	00:41:49.740	happened, Congressman? Essentially what was said, as you heard in
665	00:41:49.750	00:41:53.760	your little film clip when I made that suggestion last
666	00:41:53.770	00:41:57.830	Friday, it was further amplified later, and the answer was
667	00:41:57.840	00:42:01.790	no. Senator, why is the answer no? Well, because that's
668	00:42:01.800	00:42:04.380	just a suggestion to compromise at the higher figures in
669	00:42:04.390	00:42:07.380	each case. In other words, Congressman Gray is proposing that
670	00:42:07.390	00:42:10.150	we compromise at the Senate number, which is the high
671	00:42:10.160	00:42:12.640	number in defense and at the House number, which is
672	00:42:12.650	00:42:15.110	the high number on domestic programs, and you end up
673	00:42:15.120	00:42:17.800	without any material budget savings at all. What would the--
674	00:42:17.810	00:42:19.750	I'm saying let's go to the lower numbers in each
675	00:42:19.760	00:42:22.600	case and get a bigger deficit reduction, which is clearly
676	00:42:22.610	00:42:25.250	what's needed. I mean, the economy needs that, it's obvious
677	00:42:25.260	00:42:28.120	to all of us. In other words, the net result
678	00:42:28.130	00:42:30.490	of doing what Congressman Gray proposed would not have been
679	00:42:30.500	00:42:33.150	a $56-billion budget cut? Oh, no. It'd be much less
680	00:42:33.160	00:42:35.890	than $56 billion depending on how far you went in
681	00:42:35.900	00:42:38.060	that direction, but obviously if you take the higher numbers
682	00:42:38.070	00:42:40.780	in every budget function you end up with less savings
683	00:42:40.790	00:42:42.990	than either the House or Senate had on their own.
684	00:42:43.000	00:42:44.720	He's right, isn't he, Congressman? No. I would have to
685	00:42:44.730	00:42:47.960	disagree with my colleague, Senator Armstrong. If you did exactly
686	00:42:47.970	00:42:51.100	what I said, go to the budget authority figure for
687	00:42:51.110	00:42:54.860	'86 that the Senate had--the budget authority figure, and
688	00:42:54.870	00:42:57.590	go to our figure on COLAs, you would have, including
689	00:42:57.600	00:43:01.180	the cuts of 1.5 additional that we gave last week,
690	00:43:01.190	00:43:05.700	you would be talking about a $57.5-billion deficit reduction package,
691	00:43:05.710	00:43:10.190	which is $7 billion more than what the President asked
692	00:43:10.200	00:43:14.460	for, and $2.5 billion more than what the Senate did.
693	00:43:14.470	00:43:17.610	What we're really talking about is not simply numbers and
694	00:43:17.620	00:43:20.220	not simply going to the lowest number. We are talking
695	00:43:20.230	00:43:24.100	about policy choices and trying to bring about some balance
696	00:43:24.110	00:43:27.360	and equity in choosing policy. And so I don't think
697	00:43:27.370	00:43:30.720	it's adequate enough to just say let's go to the
698	00:43:30.730	00:43:34.160	low figure, because the House has said we do not
699	00:43:34.170	00:43:37.590	want to penalize our veterans, our senior citizens, who have
700	00:43:37.600	00:43:40.570	already had some very significant cuts over the last four
701	00:43:40.580	00:43:43.930	years. And we have said that we do want to
702	00:43:43.940	00:43:47.280	give an increase to the low-income programs, but we do
703	00:43:47.290	00:43:51.950	want to cut those non-defense discretionary spending programs. Senator Armstrong,
704	00:43:51.960	00:43:54.000	let me ask you this. It's two weeks now that
705	00:43:54.010	00:43:57.960	you've sat across the table from Congressman Gray and his
706	00:43:57.970	00:44:01.000	House colleagues. Was the spirit of compromise in the air
707	00:44:01.010	00:44:03.620	from the other side from your perspective? Yes, I think
708	00:44:03.630	00:44:07.320	so. I don't take lightly what's happened today, but it's
709	00:44:07.330	00:44:09.070	not the end of the world. We've been through these
710	00:44:09.080	00:44:12.420	things before, and there's sort of a ritual to it.
711	00:44:12.430	00:44:13.700	I believe we're going to make a deal and I
712	00:44:13.710	00:44:16.390	believe that even some things that perhaps some of the
713	00:44:16.400	00:44:19.200	participants are now saying are unthinkable will be thinkable and
714	00:44:19.210	00:44:23.780	will be done. Why? Because, in the end, the greatest
715	00:44:23.790	00:44:25.730	penalty that we can inflict upon the people of this
716	00:44:25.740	00:44:29.220	country--the veterans, the poor, business, working men and women,
717	00:44:29.230	00:44:31.760	municipalities; everybody that has a stake in it, the worst
718	00:44:31.770	00:44:34.980	thing we can do--is to just let these enormous
719	00:44:34.990	00:44:37.900	deficits occur. We're faced with the prospect of $200 billion
720	00:44:37.910	00:44:40.850	in deficits every year, and if that happens, our country's
721	00:44:40.860	00:44:42.400	economy is going through the wringer. And so I think
722	00:44:42.410	00:44:44.370	a lot of us are going to be prepared to
723	00:44:44.380	00:44:47.600	sacrifice on defense, on cost-of-living adjustments and other things in
724	00:44:47.610	00:44:50.540	order to prevent it. Congressman Gray, do you anticipate going
725	00:44:50.550	00:44:53.180	home to Philadelphia and then coming back after the 4th
726	00:44:53.190	00:44:55.440	of July with a new view toward what you could
727	00:44:55.450	00:44:59.070	compromise on this deal? Well, I don't know. I certainly
728	00:44:59.080	00:45:01.260	would be interested in hearing what the American public has
729	00:45:01.270	00:45:04.380	to say about the policy choices. We in the House
730	00:45:04.390	00:45:07.640	have offered a series of policy choices that give you
731	00:45:07.650	00:45:11.930	strong reduction by spending cuts of over $56 billion. The
732	00:45:11.940	00:45:15.350	compromise I just suggested, which, by the way, a Republican
733	00:45:15.360	00:45:18.560	member of Congress, Jack Kemp, in the conference today, said
734	00:45:18.570	00:45:22.670	was an outstanding attempt at compromise which he would support,
735	00:45:22.680	00:45:25.220	and he did not vote for the House budget. I
736	00:45:25.230	00:45:28.670	believe that that represents a good choice for the American
737	00:45:28.680	00:45:32.190	people. Obviously the Senate does not. I think that if
738	00:45:32.200	00:45:35.000	the Senate budget was put back on the floor of
739	00:45:35.010	00:45:38.080	the Senate it would not pass. However, be that as
740	00:45:38.090	00:45:40.690	it may, it is my hope that we will come
741	00:45:40.700	00:45:43.700	back and will be able to reach agreement. If we
742	00:45:43.710	00:45:45.780	do not, I am going to urge the leadership of
743	00:45:45.790	00:45:48.840	the House to move forward with our appropriation bills in
744	00:45:48.850	00:45:54.850	July and achieve the $56-billion worth of spending cuts by
745	00:45:54.860	00:45:57.820	keeping under the targets set by the Budget Committee and
746	00:45:57.830	00:46:01.130	thus show the American people by September that we have
747	00:46:01.140	00:46:03.470	cut spending for fiscal year '86. And just go it
748	00:46:03.480	00:46:07.090	alone, in other words? If necessary, go it alone, and
749	00:46:07.100	00:46:09.530	because I just think that when I see the President,
750	00:46:09.540	00:46:12.420	who is walking away from this process, Stockman revising his
751	00:46:12.430	00:46:18.250	estimates, a tax reform package that is a revenue loser,
752	00:46:18.260	00:46:21.120	I think that the problem that my friend Mr. Domenici
753	00:46:21.130	00:46:24.070	faces--and I have the greatest respect for him--is
754	00:46:24.080	00:46:28.000	that basically he doesn't have enough support to do what
755	00:46:28.010	00:46:30.870	he needs to do in terms of compromising on some
756	00:46:30.880	00:46:33.210	key issues like defense and COLAs. Is that right, Senator
757	00:46:33.220	00:46:36.420	Armstrong? No, I don't think so. I think in fact
758	00:46:36.430	00:46:40.070	that it's easy to talk about achieving these budget savings
759	00:46:40.080	00:46:44.370	without a budget resolution, as Congressman Gray is doing, if
760	00:46:44.380	00:46:46.480	all you're really talking about doing is whacking it out
761	00:46:46.490	00:46:48.550	of defense, which is the biggest single component of the
762	00:46:48.560	00:46:51.470	House plan. We're calling in the Senate resolution, and I
763	00:46:51.480	00:46:54.080	hope in the final version, that we will see basic
764	00:46:54.090	00:46:58.500	reform, meaning statutory change in programs like Amtrak, UDAG and
765	00:46:58.510	00:47:01.240	many of the programs--the Ex-Im Bank. That's not a
766	00:47:01.250	00:47:04.010	simple job and you can't just do it through appropriations.
767	00:47:04.020	00:47:05.970	You need the discipline of the budget process. All right.
768	00:47:05.980	00:47:07.880	Well, gentlemen, both of you have a good holiday and
769	00:47:07.890	00:47:10.370	we'll see you and what happens when you come back.
770	00:47:10.380	00:47:14.440	Thanks. Thanks a lot. Robin? They just mentioned tax reform.
771	00:47:14.450	00:47:16.780	In the last few weeks President Reagan has been pushing
772	00:47:16.790	00:47:20.800	his tax reform, tax simplification plan as a proposal that
773	00:47:20.810	00:47:24.640	will benefit all Americans. Tonight we have a newsmaker interview
774	00:47:24.650	00:47:27.320	with the man faced with the political realities of getting
775	00:47:27.330	00:47:30.510	that tax plan, or some version of it, through Congress.
776	00:47:30.520	00:47:33.500	He is Republican Senator Robert Packwood of Oregon, chairman of
777	00:47:33.510	00:47:36.760	the Senate Finance Committee. Judy Woodruff has the interview and
778	00:47:36.770	00:47:40.790	the background. Judy? Senator Packwood has said he agrees with
779	00:47:40.800	00:47:43.270	the need for tax reform in general, but he has
780	00:47:43.280	00:47:48.060	charged that the Reagan tax plan hurts middle-class taxpayers. Specifically
781	00:47:48.070	00:47:51.340	he objects to a proposal to eliminate a key deduction
782	00:47:51.350	00:47:54.600	for families with two wage earners who can currently write
783	00:47:54.610	00:47:57.440	off part of their income. And he also opposes part
784	00:47:57.450	00:48:01.200	of the administration's plan which reduces the tax benefit for
785	00:48:01.210	00:48:05.270	families who deduct child care expenses, a concept the administration
786	00:48:05.280	00:48:09.470	itself is now considering rewriting. Senator Packwood joins us here
787	00:48:09.480	00:48:12.080	in our Washington studio. Senator, first of all, let me
788	00:48:12.090	00:48:14.620	ask you about this stalemate on the budget. What effect
789	00:48:14.630	00:48:17.970	does it have on tax reform if there is no,
790	00:48:17.980	00:48:21.360	or if there may be no, agreement on budget? Almost
791	00:48:21.370	00:48:24.190	none, Judy. We've been moving along on tax reform. The
792	00:48:24.200	00:48:26.440	House has been having hearings, we've been having hearings in
793	00:48:26.450	00:48:29.500	the Senate. And we were going to go along and
794	00:48:29.510	00:48:31.210	get a tax bill or not get a tax bill,
795	00:48:31.220	00:48:33.600	as the case may be, regardless of the budget. So
796	00:48:33.610	00:48:35.860	it makes no difference. Which one takes precedence in your
797	00:48:35.870	00:48:38.990	mind? Oh, in my mind getting the deficit down, the
798	00:48:39.000	00:48:42.410	budget takes precedence. We can do both, but if you
799	00:48:42.420	00:48:46.870	had to pick just one, I would pick the budget
800	00:48:46.880	00:48:50.340	and the deficit reduction because we will work and sweat
801	00:48:50.350	00:48:53.820	and scream and argue about the tax reform bill and
802	00:48:53.830	00:48:56.720	at the end of it, if we're lucky, it's what
803	00:48:56.730	00:48:58.890	we call revenue neutral--it doesn't lose any money, it
804	00:48:58.900	00:49:00.910	doesn't pick up any money. So it means it doesn't
805	00:49:00.920	00:49:05.370	make a dime's dent in the deficit. So if there
806	00:49:05.380	00:49:08.460	is no agreement on the deficit, what you're saying is
807	00:49:08.470	00:49:11.130	that tax reform what, has the same--Tax reform goes
808	00:49:11.140	00:49:14.880	right ahead because the budget was unrelated to the tax
809	00:49:14.890	00:49:17.510	reform bill. The budget that passed the House, the budget
810	00:49:17.520	00:49:20.870	that passed the Senate, didn't ask for any additional taxes.
811	00:49:20.880	00:49:23.850	So there was no imposition on my committee in the
812	00:49:23.860	00:49:26.030	Senate and Chairman Rostenkowski in the House to come up
813	00:49:26.040	00:49:30.040	with any new taxes. And the President's tax reform bill
814	00:49:30.050	00:49:33.490	doesn't ask for any new taxes. So we're just working
815	00:49:33.500	00:49:36.070	along on a bill that, if we succeed, will not
816	00:49:36.080	00:49:40.260	increase nor, hopefully, decrease the federal revenues. We just heard
817	00:49:40.270	00:49:43.520	Senator Armstrong say that he thinks the number-one priority, domestic
818	00:49:43.530	00:49:47.590	priority in the minds of Americans now is deficit reduction.
819	00:49:47.600	00:49:51.600	He didn't mention tax reform in that context. Where is
820	00:49:51.610	00:49:55.020	the priority on tax reform? Well, when you go home--
821	00:49:55.030	00:49:56.450	and this is the best way you can judge it,
822	00:49:56.460	00:49:59.680	because letters are now so instigated you're never sure if
823	00:49:59.690	00:50:01.920	they're an accurate reflection of public opinion. There is no
824	00:50:01.930	00:50:05.500	question when you go home the top of the list
825	00:50:05.510	00:50:09.760	question is deficit, deficit, deficit, cut defense spending, put limitations
826	00:50:09.770	00:50:13.570	on the COLAs, get those deficits down. Tax reform is
827	00:50:13.580	00:50:17.000	much lower down in the public conscious--they may get
828	00:50:17.010	00:50:20.030	to it, but normally--normally when you get to it,
829	00:50:20.040	00:50:23.430	it is a question asked by somebody who doesn't like
830	00:50:23.440	00:50:26.170	some particular provision in the tax reform plan. So how
831	00:50:26.180	00:50:29.530	does that affect you and the goal you've set for
832	00:50:29.540	00:50:32.270	yourself? Oh, when you've been in this business long enough,
833	00:50:32.280	00:50:34.990	you realize it's the squeaky wheel that you hear. Those
834	00:50:35.000	00:50:37.690	who benefit from the tax reform plan, and there are
835	00:50:37.700	00:50:41.080	many who do benefit, don't say much about it. Those
836	00:50:41.090	00:50:43.640	who are hurt, or think they're hurt, complain a lot.
837	00:50:43.650	00:50:45.300	And you've got to judge that and you've got to
838	00:50:45.310	00:50:48.780	realize that the complainers are not always a majority. All
839	00:50:48.790	00:50:51.660	right, let's talk about your objection to abandoning the deduction
840	00:50:51.670	00:50:54.950	for two-earner families. First of all, in simple terms, how
841	00:50:54.960	00:50:58.010	does the current law work? In simple terms it works
842	00:50:58.020	00:51:02.730	as follows. Let's say you make $25,000 and your husband
843	00:51:02.740	00:51:07.620	makes $20,000. And before you got married you each paid
844	00:51:07.630	00:51:09.790	a tax--you on 25; he paid a tax on
845	00:51:09.800	00:51:14.160	20. Thanks for giving me the higher salary. Well, I
846	00:51:14.170	00:51:16.070	know your husband, as a matter of fact. He'll probably
847	00:51:16.080	00:51:17.630	call me on that when I said that. But in
848	00:51:17.640	00:51:21.670	any event, there is a situation where often you paid
849	00:51:21.680	00:51:24.590	less taxes individually than you paid collectively if you got
850	00:51:24.600	00:51:26.700	married. That was called the marriage penalty, and it was
851	00:51:26.710	00:51:31.340	incentive--alleged an incentive--not to get married. So we
852	00:51:31.350	00:51:33.930	passed a law some time ago that said in that
853	00:51:33.940	00:51:39.920	situation you can take as a deduction 10% of the
854	00:51:39.930	00:51:42.750	lesser earning spouse's amount. In your case, if your husband
855	00:51:42.760	00:51:47.000	made $20,000, you could take a $2,000 deduction. The administration's
856	00:51:47.010	00:51:50.060	bill just gets rid of that. And what does that
857	00:51:50.070	00:51:52.350	mean for the middle class? Well, what it means is
858	00:51:52.360	00:51:55.950	that if you've got a wife and a husband, say,
859	00:51:55.960	00:51:59.920	total they're making 30, $35,000 together and they've got a
860	00:51:59.930	00:52:01.910	couple of children and maybe one's four or five and
861	00:52:01.920	00:52:06.840	one of them's in a day care facility, they probably
862	00:52:06.850	00:52:10.350	come out losers on the bill by a slight amount,
863	00:52:10.360	00:52:12.460	and I don't--none of us in Congress intended that.
864	00:52:12.470	00:52:16.030	I don't think the administration deliberately intended that, but it
865	00:52:16.040	00:52:18.700	was interesting when we first had the statistics from the
866	00:52:18.710	00:52:21.890	Treasury Department, one of us--I wasn't, but one of
867	00:52:21.900	00:52:23.490	us should have been smart enough to say, wait a
868	00:52:23.500	00:52:27.410	minute, there's something missing because there were no statistics on
869	00:52:27.420	00:52:29.900	these two-earner families. Well, now what are you saying, because
870	00:52:29.910	00:52:34.090	I remember Secretary Baker, the treasury secretary, said that middle-income
871	00:52:34.100	00:52:38.320	families will benefit? Well, but the statistics we had were
872	00:52:38.330	00:52:43.760	one-earner families and normally it was husband works, wife stays
873	00:52:43.770	00:52:47.610	home. Therefore they have no day care expenses either because
874	00:52:47.620	00:52:50.410	the wife is staying home with the children. Now, were
875	00:52:50.420	00:52:55.210	those statistics left out intentionally? I hope not. But none
876	00:52:55.220	00:52:58.200	of us caught it initially. One of the nice things
877	00:52:58.210	00:53:00.190	you can say about lobbying groups in the town of
878	00:53:00.200	00:53:02.850	Washington, because they always get knocked a lot, is in
879	00:53:02.860	00:53:05.380	this case the ones that picked it up first were
880	00:53:05.390	00:53:08.710	the lobbying groups that represent the single parents who are
881	00:53:08.720	00:53:11.920	interested in day care or representing two-earner families, and they
882	00:53:11.930	00:53:14.910	caught this right away. So you're proposing that we keep
883	00:53:14.920	00:53:17.390	the law as is? Well, I think the treasury's going
884	00:53:17.400	00:53:19.210	to change it, unless I miss my guess, because I
885	00:53:19.220	00:53:22.710	don't think the administration wants to go forward with a
886	00:53:22.720	00:53:26.020	bill that is going to penalize people who are not
887	00:53:26.030	00:53:28.970	taking advantage of shelters--they're not putting their money in
888	00:53:28.980	00:53:32.500	cattle feed lots or something like that. They are honest,
889	00:53:32.510	00:53:34.640	decent people who bowl on Wednesday and take their kids
890	00:53:34.650	00:53:36.520	hunting and fishing on Saturday, and they're lucky to make
891	00:53:36.530	00:53:40.770	30, $35,000, and I cannot believe that the administration wants
892	00:53:40.780	00:53:43.030	to penalize them. Now, the same thing with the child
893	00:53:43.040	00:53:46.220	care tax benefit. What you had there--at the moment
894	00:53:46.230	00:53:49.950	you have what is known as a child care credit.
895	00:53:49.960	00:53:52.800	A credit is money you can deduct from the taxes
896	00:53:52.810	00:53:55.360	you actually owe. If you have a $200 credit and
897	00:53:55.370	00:53:59.590	you owe $1,000 taxes, you pay $800. That's a credit.
898	00:53:59.600	00:54:04.640	A deduction is an amount that you deduct from your
899	00:54:04.650	00:54:09.190	total income before you figure your taxes. You make $50,000,
900	00:54:09.200	00:54:13.670	you have a $1,000 deduction, you pay taxes on $49,000.
901	00:54:13.680	00:54:17.750	Well, if you're in the 50% tax bracket, and you
902	00:54:17.760	00:54:21.050	deduct $1,000, that's worth $500 to you. If you're in
903	00:54:21.060	00:54:26.320	the 20% tax bracket, it's worth $200, whereas a credit
904	00:54:26.330	00:54:29.210	is worth the same to everybody, rich or poor. So
905	00:54:29.220	00:54:31.640	it tilts downward toward the poorer families. So what do
906	00:54:31.650	00:54:33.260	you think the administration will do on that? Well, I
907	00:54:33.270	00:54:35.290	don't know what the administration will do on this because
908	00:54:35.300	00:54:37.200	they knew what the credit was, they changed it from
909	00:54:37.210	00:54:40.690	a credit, which tilts toward lower income to a deduction,
910	00:54:40.700	00:54:46.340	which tilts toward higher income. That, combined with the elimination
911	00:54:46.350	00:54:51.830	of this so-called marriage deduction, hurts a lot of middle-income,
912	00:54:51.840	00:54:54.720	two-earner families with one or two children. And I just
913	00:54:54.730	00:54:57.350	cannot believe the administration wants to do that. But you
914	00:54:57.360	00:54:59.300	said a minute ago you don't know--I don't know
915	00:54:59.310	00:55:01.390	what they're going to do. If it was done deliberately
916	00:55:01.400	00:55:04.140	or what. I mean, what do you think? I mean,
917	00:55:04.150	00:55:05.260	you talk to these people. I hope not. I hope
918	00:55:05.270	00:55:07.490	not. Well, I don't think Jim Baker, the secretary of
919	00:55:07.500	00:55:11.150	the treasury, did it deliberately. I mean, I know him.
920	00:55:11.160	00:55:14.300	I know the knock that's going around. You know, Pat
921	00:55:14.310	00:55:16.820	Buchanan says a traditional family is the man and you
922	00:55:16.830	00:55:18.460	stay home and take care of the kids and we
923	00:55:18.470	00:55:21.130	won't have as many drug problems and juvenile delinquency problems
924	00:55:21.140	00:55:25.530	and auto wrecks and all of that. And that isn't
925	00:55:25.540	00:55:31.150	the typical family anymore. The typical married family today, the
926	00:55:31.160	00:55:36.370	husband and the wife work, for money, in the marketplace.
927	00:55:36.380	00:55:38.870	So do you think the administration is just behind the
928	00:55:38.880	00:55:43.360	times or what? Oh, we all indulge in nostalgia and
929	00:55:43.370	00:55:44.890	we all remember when we grew up, and I guess
930	00:55:44.900	00:55:47.560	when most of us my age grew up there were
931	00:55:47.570	00:55:51.040	many, many, many fewer women, fewer mothers in the work
932	00:55:51.050	00:55:53.430	force working for money. Today that is just not the
933	00:55:53.440	00:55:56.190	situation, and we're not going to turn the clock back.
934	00:55:56.200	00:55:57.680	We're not going to go back. Those women are not
935	00:55:57.690	00:56:00.000	going to leave the labor force. And we might as
936	00:56:00.010	00:56:03.910	well realize that that is the family in America today.
937	00:56:03.920	00:56:06.910	You'd like to see these provisions changed, obviously. Any other
938	00:56:06.920	00:56:10.240	provisions in there that you think doom or seriously hurt
939	00:56:10.250	00:56:13.620	the prospects for the administration's plan? Oh, everything--almost everything
940	00:56:13.630	00:56:18.010	that's in it causes the bill to have some negatives
941	00:56:18.020	00:56:20.770	in some people's minds. You're familiar with the--especially New
942	00:56:20.780	00:56:24.480	York City and the state and local tax deduction. Any
943	00:56:24.490	00:56:28.850	state that's a high-tax state thinks that they suffer under
944	00:56:28.860	00:56:31.470	this. But I think on that what you want to
945	00:56:31.480	00:56:34.050	do is look at the bill at the end. The
946	00:56:34.060	00:56:36.360	example I would give you there, would you rather pay
947	00:56:36.370	00:56:42.360	10% taxes on $20,000 of income, which would be $2,000
948	00:56:42.370	00:56:46.570	taxes, or would you rather pay 4% or 5% taxes
949	00:56:46.580	00:56:49.850	on $30,000 income and not have any deductions? Clearly the
950	00:56:49.860	00:56:52.530	latter. Overall, do you still predict a bill by the
951	00:56:52.540	00:56:54.530	end of the year? It's tight, but if the House
952	00:56:54.540	00:56:56.630	can get a bill to the Senate by October 15th,
953	00:56:56.640	00:56:58.010	we can have one to the President by the end
954	00:56:58.020	00:57:00.770	of the year. Senator Robert Packwood, thank you for being
955	00:57:00.780	00:57:04.030	with us. Thank you. Jim? Again, the major stories of
956	00:57:04.040	00:57:07.370	this day. President Reagan is considering an economic boycott of
957	00:57:07.380	00:57:10.920	Lebanon. House and Senate conferees broke off negotiations on a
958	00:57:10.930	00:57:15.760	1986 federal budget, saying their differences were irreconcilable for now,
959	00:57:15.770	00:57:18.010	and more than 20 persons died in a series of
960	00:57:18.020	00:57:22.820	explosions in an Oklahoma fireworks factory. Good night, Robin. Good
961	00:57:22.830	00:57:25.200	night, Jim. That's our NewsHour tonight. We'll be back tomorrow
962	00:57:25.210	00:59:52.878	night. I'm Robert MacNeil. Good night.
