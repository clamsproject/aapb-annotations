# This batch contains one handpicked video for scene recognition with variability
# in slates, chyrons and credits. This batch is compiled to conduct point-wise as
# well as interval-wise evaluation of Scene Recognition apps (for example, the SWT
# app at https://github.com/clamsproject/app-swt-detection).
#
# See https://github.com/clamsproject/aapb-collaboration/issues/27 for the issue 
# on time frame detection that motivated this batch and related batches.
