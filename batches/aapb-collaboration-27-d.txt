# This batch contains one handpicked videos for scene recognition with variability
# in slates, chyrons and credits. This batch-27-d is compiled to conduct point-wise
# as well interval-wise evaluation of Scene Recognition apps (for example, the SWT
# app at https://github.com/clamsproject/app-swt-detection).
#
# See https://github.com/clamsproject/aapb-collaboration/issues/27 for the issue
